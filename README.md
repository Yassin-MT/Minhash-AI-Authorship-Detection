# Minhash-AI-Authorship-Detection

We theorize that AI-generated content contains repeatable patterns, and by observing average similarity between all AI-generated prompts, we will be able to uncover a baseline similarity score. Using this baseline, we will be able to classify future inputs (AI or otherwise) by comparing them to our training set comprising of AI responses.
