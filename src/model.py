Adolf Loos, the Austrian architect and critic, presented a compelling argument in his essay "Ornament and Crime," wherein he condemned ornamentation as a sign of degeneracy and criminality in society. Loos believed that the modern world should strive for simplicity and functionality, rejecting unnecessary embellishments. In evaluating Jean Nouvel's Louvre Museum in Abu Dhabi, it is crucial to examine how Loos' ideas on ornamentation align with or differ from the design philosophy and execution of this contemporary architectural masterpiece.
The Louvre Abu Dhabi, completed in 2018, is characterized by a double dome spanning 180 meters in diameter. Nouvel's design incorporates a meticulously perforated woven material, creating a play of light and shadow, reflection, and calm. The building's exterior exudes a sense of serenity and elegance, fulfilling Nouvel's vision of a structure that harmonizes with its surroundings. The use of a random perforation pattern adds a layer of complexity to the exterior, which stands in contrast to Loos' call for simplicity.
From Loos' perspective, the ornamentation of the Louvre Abu Dhabi may be viewed as a departure from his ideals. The intricate perforation pattern and the gleaming dome, although aesthetically pleasing, could be interpreted as ornamental elements that defy Loos' vision of a crime-free architecture. Loos argued that ornamentation was a regression to primitive instincts and an impediment to societal progress. In this context, Nouvel's design might be seen as embracing a decorative language that Loos deemed criminal.
However, it is essential to consider the broader context of the Louvre Abu Dhabi, including the human rights issues raised during its construction. The Human Rights Watch report cited in Oliver Wainwright's essay highlights the plight of laborers working on the project. This socio-economic aspect introduces a layer of complexity to the evaluation. Loos' argument against ornamentation did not explicitly address ethical concerns related to the construction process.
In Anne Anlin Cheng's text, "Ornamentalism," she explores the racial and colonial dimensions of ornamentation. Applying Cheng's perspective to the Louvre Abu Dhabi, one could argue that the use of ornamentation here may be seen as a reflection of power dynamics and global politics. The museum, commissioned by a wealthy Gulf state, draws attention to the geopolitical implications of cultural institutions.
In conclusion, Adolf Loos would likely criticize the ornamentation of Jean Nouvel's Louvre Abu Dhabi, considering it a departure from his ideals of a crime-free, functional architecture. However, incorporating Anne Anlin Cheng's insights adds nuance to the evaluation, prompting us to consider the broader socio-political context of the project. The beauty of the Louvre Abu Dhabi's ornamentation should not overshadow the ethical concerns raised during its construction, urging us to view it through a critical lens that combines both Loos' and Cheng's perspectives.

Adolf Loos, the renowned Austrian architect and critic, articulated a distinctive perspective on ornamentation in his essay "Ornament and Crime," asserting that unnecessary embellishments represent a degeneration of culture. However, when evaluating Jean Nouvel's Louvre Museum in Abu Dhabi, Loos might find unexpected merit in the ornamentation that adorns this contemporary masterpiece, challenging his own principles.
Nouvel's Louvre Abu Dhabi, completed in 2018, stands as a testament to a harmonious blend of form and function. The 180-meter diameter double dome is adorned with a randomly perforated woven material, creating a mesmerizing interplay of light and shadow. Far from being superfluous, this ornamentation serves a functional purpose, providing shade while punctuating the exterior with bursts of sunlight. In this light, the ornamentation in Nouvel's design could be interpreted as a thoughtful integration of aesthetics and utility.
Loos' emphasis on simplicity and functionality might still find resonance in the Louvre Abu Dhabi. The perforation pattern, while intricate, is not gratuitous but rather an integral part of the building's design, enhancing both its visual appeal and environmental responsiveness. Loos' argument against ornamentation was rooted in his belief that it hindered societal progress; however, in the case of Nouvel's Louvre, one might argue that the ornamentation contributes to architectural innovation and a meaningful dialogue between tradition and modernity.
Considering Anne Anlin Cheng's perspective on ornamentation, which explores its racial and colonial dimensions, one could argue that the ornamentation in the Louvre Abu Dhabi serves as a powerful expression of cultural identity. Commissioned by the United Arab Emirates, the museum reflects the rich history and geographical context of the region. In this light, Loos might appreciate how the ornamentation transcends mere decoration, becoming a symbolic representation of a nation's heritage and aspirations.
Moreover, Loos' critique of ornamentation did not explicitly address ethical considerations related to the construction process. Acknowledging the reported labor issues during the Louvre Abu Dhabi's construction, one could argue that the ornamentation, while visually stunning, also raises questions about the ethical implications of the project. Loos, who was concerned with the moral aspect of architecture, might encourage a deeper examination of the socio-economic conditions surrounding the construction.
In conclusion, Adolf Loos' support for the ornamentation in Jean Nouvel's Louvre Abu Dhabi may stem from a reevaluation of his own principles in light of the project's unique qualities. The functional significance of the ornamentation, its cultural symbolism, and the potential ethical concerns raised during construction provide a nuanced perspective that challenges Loos' staunch rejection of ornamentation. In embracing the complexity of Nouvel's design, one can envision a scenario where Loos, recognizing the thoughtful integration of ornamentation, might offer unexpected support for the Louvre Abu Dhabi.

Adolf Loos would vehemently criticize The Louvre Abu Dhabi due to his views on ornamentation, which are diametrically opposed to the building's main feature: the 180m-in- diameter double dome. Indeed, the double dome, each side covered in geometric patterns of multiple layers, which differ in sizes and orientation, cannot be considered anything but ornamentation. According to Loos, “The evolution of culture is synonymous with the removal of ornamentation from objects of everyday use” (Loos 1984, 167). Thus, we can clearly identify a conflict. Using Loos' analogy of preferring the piece of plain gingerbread over the piece shaped like “a heart, or a baby, or cavalryman,” we can apply this to the double dome that is in fact “covered over and over with decoration” (Loos 1984, 169) with layers of repeating stars made of squares and triangles, something that Loos would reject. Simplicity is what architects should strive for. Furthermore, the Louvre Abu Dhabi's ornamentation is not only contained to its double dome; one cannot fail to notice how the building's base – the pristine white walls of the interior – is punctured by the tattoos of light imprinting themselves on all surfaces. This eradicates the pure simplicity and innocence of the while walls, daubing them with aggressive, distorted, and non-distinguishable patterns akin to primitive and erotic symbols as defined by Loos. Something only “a criminal or a degenerate” would do (Loos 1984, 167).
However, Loos' criticism would go beyond a simple disagreement on style and design. The wasted labor and materials, coupled with the real-world abuse of the project laborers, would be fundamental to Loos' opposition to The Louvre Abu Dhabi. To begin with, there is a clear and evident waste of material caused by the layers of ornamentation on both the interior and exterior of the structure. Each added layer of surface requires more material than necessary to achieve the same functionality. It also adds excessive complexity regarding these added materials used to support the dome and hold it all together. This added complexity is not only a waste of materials,
but also represents a waste of labor. Loos argues that ornamentation is “but a symptom of backwardness or degeneracy” and that “the craftsman producing the ornament is not fairly rewarded for his labor” (Loos 1984, 170). Indeed, the “criminally low rates” paid to the ornamental craftsmen are “well-known” (Loos 1984, 170-171). There is no doubt that the overly complex and outright convoluted support structure of the double dome, consisting of 360-degree joints with beams of differing sizes and orientations, requires significantly more work to build. As Loos succinctly puts it: “An ornamental craftsman has to work for twenty hours to reach the pay a modern worker earns in eight” (Loos 1984, 171) There is also the fact that the workers are not only are paid less and must work more, but are moreover subject to exploitative and abusive treatment. The illegal recruitment fees these workers are required to pay off are just one example of many.
Finally, while one could argue that the pattern found on the double dome of The Louvre Abu Dhabi in its most basic form (i.e., stars made of squares and triangles) is modern and/or contemporary, one cannot forget that this pattern only reflects today's tastes. While society today might look at this building and believe that it is stylistic, “The changing fashion in ornament results in a premature devaluation of the product of the worker's labor” (Loos 1984, 172). This means that Jean Nouvel has sealed his fate. From Adolf Loos' perspective, Nouvel's attempt to build a timeless building through its artistic design has instead subjected the Louvre Abu Dhabi to future irrelevancy, due to society's ever-changing culture.
