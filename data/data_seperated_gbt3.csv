Seeing maximum entropy from the principle of virtual work,"  We propose an extension of the principle of virtual work of mechanics to
random dynamics of mechanical systems. The total virtual work of the
interacting forces and inertial forces on every particle of the system is
calculated by considering the motion of each particle. Then according to the
principle of Lagrange-d'Alembert for dynamical equilibrium, the vanishing
ensemble average of the virtual work gives rise to the thermodynamic
equilibrium state with maximization of thermodynamic entropy. This approach
establishes a close relationship between the maximum entropy approach for
statistical mechanics and a fundamental principle of mechanics, and constitutes
an attempt to give the maximum entropy approach, considered by many as only an
inference principle based on the subjectivity of probability and entropy, the
status of fundamental physics law.

Microlocal Asymptotic Analysis in Algebras of Generalized Functions,"  We introduce a new type of local and microlocal asymptotic analysis in
algebras of generalized functions, based on the presheaf properties of those
algebras and on the properties of their elements with respect to a regularizing
parameter. Contrary to the more classical frequential analysis based on the
Fourier transform, we can describe a singular asymptotic spectrum which has
good properties with respect to nonlinear operations. In this spirit we give
several examples of propagation of singularities through nonlinear operators.

Vacuum Energy and Renormalization on the Edge,"  The vacuum dependence on boundary conditions in quantum field theories is
analysed from a very general viewpoint. From this perspective the
renormalization prescriptions not only imply the renormalization of the
couplings of the theory in the bulk but also the appearance of a flow in the
space of boundary conditions. For regular boundaries this flow has a large
variety of fixed points and no cyclic orbit. The family of fixed points
includes Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. In one-dimensional field
theories pseudoperiodic and quasiperiodic boundary conditions are also RG fixed
points. Under these conditions massless bosonic free field theories are
conformally invariant. Among all fixed points only Neumann boundary conditions
are infrared stable fixed points. All other conformal invariant boundary
conditions become unstable under some relevant perturbations. In finite volumes
we analyse the dependence of the vacuum energy along the trajectories of the
renormalization group flow providing an interesting framework for dark energy
evolution. On the contrary, the renormalization group flow on the boundary does
not affect the leading behaviour of the entanglement entropy of the vacuum in
one-dimensional conformally invariant bosonic theories.

Simplifying additivity problems using direct sum constructions,"  We study the additivity problems for the classical capacity of quantum
channels, the minimal output entropy and its convex closure. We show for each
of them that additivity for arbitrary pairs of channels holds iff it holds for
arbitrary equal pairs, which in turn can be taken to be unital. In a similar
sense, weak additivity is shown to imply strong additivity for any convex
entanglement monotone. The implications are obtained by considering direct sums
of channels (or states) for which we show how to obtain several information
theoretic quantities from their values on the summands. This provides a simple
and general tool for lifting additivity results.

"Zero-temperature resistive transition in Josephson-junction arrays at
  irrational frustration","  We use a driven Monte Carlo dynamics in the phase representation to determine
the linear resistivity and current-voltage scaling of a two-dimensional
Josephson-junction array at an irrational flux quantum per plaquette. The
results are consistent with a phase-coherence transition scenario where the
critical temperature vanishes. The linear resistivity is nonzero at any finite
temperatures but nonlinear behavior sets in at a temperature-dependent
crossover current determined by the thermal critical exponent. From a dynamic
scaling analysis we determine this critical exponent and the thermally
activated behavior of the linear resistivity. The results are in agreement with
earlier calculations using the resistively shunted-junction model for the
dynamics of the array. The linear resistivity behavior is consistent with some
experimental results on arrays of superconducting grains but not on wire

The Epps effect revisited,"  We analyse the dependence of stock return cross-correlations on the sampling
frequency of the data known as the Epps effect: For high resolution data the
cross-correlations are significantly smaller than their asymptotic value as
observed on daily data. The former description implies that changing trading
frequency should alter the characteristic time of the phenomenon. This is not
true for the empirical data: The Epps curves do not scale with market activity.
The latter result indicates that the time scale of the phenomenon is connected
to the reaction time of market participants (this we denote as human time
scale), independent of market activity. In this paper we give a new description
of the Epps effect through the decomposition of cross-correlations. After
testing our method on a model of generated random walk price changes we justify

On spherically symmetrical accretion in fractal media,"  We use fractional integrals to generalize the description of hydrodynamic

QCD in One Dimension at Nonzero Chemical Potential,"  Using an integration formula recently derived by Conrey, Farmer and
Zirnbauer, we calculate the expectation value of the phase factor of the

theory is in the same chiral symmetry class as QCD in three dimensions at zero
chemical potential. In the limit of a large number of colors and fixed number
of lattice points, chiral symmetry is broken spontaneously, and our results are
in agreement with expressions based on a chiral Lagrangian. In this limit, the
eigenvalues of the Dirac operator are correlated according to random matrix
theory for QCD in three dimensions. The discontinuity of the chiral condensate
is due to an alternative to the Banks-Casher formula recently discovered for
QCD in four dimensions at nonzero chemical potential. The effect of temperature

"""Illusion of control"" in Minority and Parrondo Games","  Human beings like to believe they are in control of their destiny. This

"SW Sextantis stars: the dominant population of CVs with orbital periods

3.35129827(65), 3.58098501(34), and 3.56937674(26) h, respectively. HS
0805+3822 shows grazing eclipses and has a likely orbital period of 3.2169(2)
h. Time-resolved optical spectroscopy of the new CVs (with the exception of HS

period of 3.55 h for HS 1813+6122, which allowed us to identify the observed
photometric signal at 3.39 h as a negative superhump wave. The spectroscopic
behaviour clearly identifies these new CVs as new SW Sextantis stars. These new
additions increase the number of known SW Sex stars to 35. Almost 40 per cent

interval are definite members of the class. These statistics are confirmed by
our results from the Hamburg Quasar Survey CVs. Remarkably, 54 per cent of the
Hamburg nova-like variables have been identified as SW Sex stars with orbital
periods in the 3-4.5 h range. The observation of this pile-up of systems close

"FUSE Observations of the Dwarf Novae UU Aql, BV Cen, and CH UMa in
  Quiescence","The research paper titled ""FUSE Observations of the Dwarf Novae UU Aql, BV Cen, and CH UMa in Quiescence"" aimed to study the composition and physical properties of the accretion disks in three dwarf novae (UU Aql, BV Cen, and CH UMa) during their quiescent states using Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) observations. The main objective was to determine the properties of the disks and understand the accretion processes that drive dwarf novae.

The study found that the accretion disks in all three dwarf novae have a high ionization state and a low-density region near the disk's midplane, indicating the presence of a hot corona. The researchers also observed the presence of an absorption component in the spectra of the three dwarf novae, which they attributed to the interstellar medium's absorption. They also detected the presence of molecular hydrogen in BV Cen's disk, which was unexpected.

The study's notable conclusion was that the FUSE observations provided valuable insights into the accretion processes in dwarf novae. The high ionization state and the presence of a hot corona suggest that the accretion process is driven by magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. The detection of molecular hydrogen in BV Cen's disk suggests that the disk's material has cooled down, and the accretion process has slowed down.

Overall, the research paper's findings have contributed to our understanding of the accretion processes and physical properties of accretion disks in dwarf novae during quiescence.",2009-06-23,True

the scanning flow cytometry (SFC), respectively. SFC permits measurement of
angular dependence of light-scattering intensity (indicatrix) of single

simulated the light-scattering output signals from the SFC with the DDA for
RBCs modeled as a disk-sphere and as an oblate spheroid. The biconcave disk,
the disk-sphere, and the oblate spheroid models have been compared for two

Two detailed examples illustrate that stability conditions can put strong
constraints on suitable refinement models, even in the absence of a fundamental
Hamiltonian which defines changes of the underlying lattice. Thus, a large

The Plasma Puddle as a Perturbative Black Hole,"  We argue that the weak coupling regime of a large N gauge theory in the Higgs
phase contains black hole-like objects. These so-called ``plasma puddles'' are
meta-stable lumps of hot plasma lying in locally un-Higgsed regions of space.
They decay via O(1/N) thermal radiation and, perhaps surprisingly, absorb all
incident matter. We show that an incident particle of energy E striking the
plasma puddle will shower into an enormous number of decay products whose
multiplicity grows linearly with E, and whose average energy is independent of
E. Once these ultra-soft particles reach the interior they are thermalized by
the plasma within, and so the object appears ``black.'' We determine some gross
properties like the size and temperature of the the plasma puddle in terms of
fundamental parameters in the gauge theory. Interestingly, demanding that the
plasma puddle emit thermal Hawking radiation implies that the object is black
(i.e. absorbs all incident particles), which implies classical stability, which
implies satisfaction of the Bekenstein entropy bound. Because of the AdS/CFT

find that the underlying spheroidally distributed population is composed of
both intermediate-age and old stars and that its age composition does not show
strong galacto-centric gradients. The three fields situated toward the east, in
the Wing region, show very active current star formation. However, only in the
eastern field closest to the center do we find an enhancement of recent star
formation with respect to a constant SFR(t). The fields corresponding to the
western side of the SMC present a much less populated young MS, and the CF

fields present few bright MS stars. The structure of the red clump in all the

Curvature perturbations from ekpyrotic collapse with multiple fields,"  A scale-invariant spectrum of isocurvature perturbations is generated during

Synthesis Radio Telescope operated in a tied-array mode at a frequency of 1200

stellar-population parameters on average with age uncertainties less than 3.89

Elasticity with Arbitrarily Shaped Inhomogeneity,"  A classical problem in elasticity theory involves an inhomogeneity embedded

new IR observations (H_2 narrow-band at 2.12 micron and N broad band at 10.4

The association of mm continuum emission with infrared sources from catalogues

Class I objects, while three objects are signalled as candidates Class 0
sources. We remark the high detection rate (30%) of H_2 jets driven by sources
located inside the mm-cores. They appear not driven by the most luminous
objects in the field, but rather by less luminous objects in young clusters,
testifying the co-existence of both low- and intermediate-mass star formation.

use a simplified model which allows to perform all calculations in closed form
without assuming a Boltzmann-Gibbs form for the equilibrium distribution.
Temperature is then defined by calculating the Legendre transform of the
entropy under certain constraints. The application of the model is limited to
flexible polymers. It exhibits a gradual transition from compact globule to
rod. The boundary line between these two phases shows reentrant behavior. This
behavior is explained by the presence of residual entropy.

Residual entropy in a model for the unfolding of single polymer chains,"The unfolding of single polymer chains is a fundamental process in polymer physics and plays a crucial role in various biological and technological applications. In this study, we investigate the residual entropy in a model for the unfolding of single polymer chains, which represents a measure of the disorder and randomness remaining in the system after it has reached its lowest energy state. Using Monte Carlo simulations and analytical calculations, we explore the dependence of residual entropy on chain length, temperature, and external force. Our results show that the residual entropy is a non-monotonic function of chain length and temperature, with a maximum value at intermediate chain lengths and temperatures. We also find that the external force has a significant effect on the residual entropy, leading to a decrease in its magnitude. These findings provide insights into the thermodynamic properties of single polymer chains and may have implications for the design of materials with desired properties.",2009-11-13,True

"Fluctuations of the partial filling factors in competitive RSA from

incident particles is studied using both an analytic recursive approach and
Monte Carlo simulations. We find a strong correlation between the small and the
large particle distributions so that while both partial contributions to the
fill factor fluctuate widely, the variance of the total fill factor remains
relatively small. The variances of partial contributions themselves are quite
different between the smaller and the larger particles, with the larger
particle distribution being more correlated. The disparity in fluctuations of
partial fill factors increases with the particle size ratio. The additional
variance in the partial contribution of smaller particle originates from the

Unification and Fermion Mass Structure,"Abstract:

The unification of fundamental forces and the mass structure of fermions are two of the most intriguing and challenging problems in modern particle physics. The Standard Model of particle physics provides a successful description of the known particles and their interactions, but it leaves many questions unanswered, such as the origin of fermion masses and the unification of the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces. Various theoretical frameworks have been proposed to address these issues, including Grand Unified Theories (GUTs), Supersymmetry (SUSY), and Extra Dimensions (EDs). In this paper, we review the current status of these theoretical models and their predictions for the unification of forces and the mass structure of fermions. We also discuss the experimental tests of these models, including the searches for proton decay, supersymmetric particles, and extra dimensions at high-energy colliders. Finally, we explore the implications of the recent experimental results from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the prospects for future discoveries in the quest for unification and fermion mass structure.",2008-11-26,True
Two-way coupling of FENE dumbbells with a turbulent shear flow,"  We present numerical studies for finitely extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE)
dumbbells which are dispersed in a turbulent plane shear flow at moderate
Reynolds number. The polymer ensemble is described on the mesoscopic level by a
set of stochastic ordinary differential equations with Brownian noise. The
dynamics of the Newtonian solvent is determined by the Navier-Stokes equations.
Momentum transfer of the dumbbells with the solvent is implemented by an
additional volume forcing term in the Navier-Stokes equations, such that both
components of the resulting viscoelastic fluid are connected by a two-way
coupling. The dynamics of the dumbbells is given then by Newton's second law of
motion including small inertia effects. We investigate the dynamics of the flow
for different degrees of dumbbell elasticity and inertia, as given by
Weissenberg and Stokes numbers, respectively. For the parameters accessible in
our study, the magnitude of the feedback of the polymers on the macroscopic
properties of turbulence remains small as quantified by the global energy
budget and the Reynolds stresses. A reduction of the turbulent drag by up to
20% is observed for the larger particle inertia. The angular statistics of the
dumbbells shows an increasing alignment with the mean flow direction for both,
increasing elasticity and inertia. This goes in line with a growing asymmetry
of the probability density function of the transverse derivative of the
streamwise turbulent velocity component. We find that dumbbells get stretched
referentially in regions where vortex stretching or bi-axial strain dominate

Evidence for a merger of binary white dwarfs: the case of GD 362,"  GD 362 is a massive white dwarf with a spectrum suggesting a H-rich

accreted from either a dusty disk or from an asteroid belt. Here we propose
that the envelope of GD 362 is dominated by He, which at these effective
temperatures is almost completely invisible in the spectrum. This assumption
strongly alleviates the problem, since the diffusion timescales are much larger

The Measurement Calculus,"  Measurement-based quantum computation has emerged from the physics community

Standardization has far-reaching consequences: a new physical architecture
based on performing all the entanglement in the beginning, parallelization by
exposing the dependency structure of measurements and expressiveness theorems.
  Furthermore we formalize several other measurement-based models:
Teleportation, Phase and Pauli models and present compositional embeddings of
them into and from the one-way model. This allows us to transfer all the theory

Phase Transitions in the Coloring of Random Graphs,"  We consider the problem of coloring the vertices of a large sparse random
graph with a given number of colors so that no adjacent vertices have the same
color. Using the cavity method, we present a detailed and systematic analytical
study of the space of proper colorings (solutions).
  We show that for a fixed number of colors and as the average vertex degree
(number of constraints) increases, the set of solutions undergoes several phase
transitions similar to those observed in the mean field theory of glasses.
First, at the clustering transition, the entropically dominant part of the
phase space decomposes into an exponential number of pure states so that beyond
this transition a uniform sampling of solutions becomes hard. Afterward, the
space of solutions condenses over a finite number of the largest states and
consequently the total entropy of solutions becomes smaller than the annealed
one. Another transition takes place when in all the entropically dominant
states a finite fraction of nodes freezes so that each of these nodes is
allowed a single color in all the solutions inside the state. Eventually, above
the coloring threshold, no more solutions are available. We compute all the
critical connectivities for Erdos-Renyi and regular random graphs and determine
their asymptotic values for large number of colors.
  Finally, we discuss the algorithmic consequences of our findings. We argue
that the onset of computational hardness is not associated with the clustering
transition and we suggest instead that the freezing transition might be the
relevant phenomenon. We also discuss the performance of a simple local Walk-COL
algorithm and of the belief propagation algorithm in the light of our results.

Parametric Learning and Monte Carlo Optimization,"  This paper uncovers and explores the close relationship between Monte Carlo
Optimization of a parametrized integral (MCO), Parametric machine-Learning

problem into an MCO problem. Accordingly, by combining these first two
contributions, we can apply all PL techniques to BO. In our third contribution
we validate this way of improving BO by demonstrating that cross-validation and
bagging improve immediate sampling. Finally, conventional MC and MCO procedures
ignore the relationship between the sample point locations and the associated
values of the integrand; only the values of the integrand at those locations

"On the Structure and Properties of Differentially Rotating Main-Sequence
  Stars in the 1-2 M_sun Range","  We conduct a systematic examination of the properties of models for
chemically homogeneous, differentially rotating, main-sequence stars of mass
1-2 M_sun. The models were constructed using a code based on a reformulation of
the self-consistent field method of computing the equilibrium stellar structure
for a specified conservative internal rotation law. [abridged] Relative to
nonrotating stars of the same mass, these models all have reduced luminosities
and effective temperatures, and flattened photospheric shapes (i.e., decreased
polar radii) with equatorial radii that can be larger or smaller, depending on
the degree of differential rotation. For a fixed ratio of the axial rotation
rate to the surface equatorial rotation rate, increasingly rapid rotation
generally deepens convective envelopes, shrinks convective cores, and can lead
to the presence of a convective core (envelope) in a 1 M_sun (2 M_sun) model, a
feature that is absent in a nonrotating star of the same mass. The positions of
differentially rotating models for a given mass M in the H-R diagram can be
shifted in such a way as to approximate the nonrotating ZAMS over ranges in
luminosity and effective temperature that correspond to a mass interval between
M and about 0.7 M. We briefly note a few of the implications of these results,
including (i) possible ambiguities arising from similarities between the
properties of rotating and nonrotating models of different masses, (ii) a
reduced radiative luminosity for a young, rapidly rotating Sun, (iii) the

accompanied by a sudden change from incommensurate to commensurate wave vector
modulation, in DyMnO3 the wave vector varies continuously through the flop
transition. This smooth behavior may be related to the giant magnetocapacitive

Realizable Hamiltonians for Universal Adiabatic Quantum Computers,"  It has been established that local lattice spin Hamiltonians can be used for
universal adiabatic quantum computation. However, the 2-local model
Hamiltonians used in these proofs are general and hence do not limit the types

paper provides two simple model Hamiltonians that are of practical interest to
experimentalists working towards the realization of a universal adiabatic
quantum computer. The model Hamiltonians presented are the simplest known
QMA-complete 2-local Hamiltonians. The 2-local Ising model with 1-local
transverse field which has been realized using an array of technologies, is
perhaps the simplest quantum spin model but is unlikely to be universal for
adiabatic quantum computation. We demonstrate that this model can be rendered
universal and QMA-complete by adding a tunable 2-local transverse XX coupling.
We also show the universality and QMA-completeness of spin models with only
1-local Z and X fields and 2-local ZX interactions.

Antenna Combining for the MIMO Downlink Channel,"  A multiple antenna downlink channel where limited channel feedback is

Supersymmetry versus Gauge Symmetry on the Heterotic Landscape,"  One of the goals of the landscape program in string theory is to extract
information about the space of string vacua in the form of statistical

we study statistical correlations between two features which are likely to be
central to any potential description of nature at high energy scales: gauge
symmetries and spacetime supersymmetry. We analyze correlations between these
two kinds of symmetry within the context of perturbative heterotic string
vacua, and find a number of striking features. We find, for example, that the
degree of spacetime supersymmetry is strongly correlated with the probabilities
of realizing certain gauge groups, with unbroken supersymmetry at the string
scale tending to favor gauge-group factors with larger rank. We also find that
nearly half of the heterotic landscape is non-supersymmetric and yet

Identifying Dark Matter Burners in the Galactic center,"  If the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of our Galaxy grew
adiabatically, then a dense ""spike"" of dark matter is expected to have formed
around it. Assuming that dark matter is composed primarily of weakly
interacting massive particles (WIMPs), a star orbiting close enough to the SMBH
can capture WIMPs at an extremely high rate. The stellar luminosity due to
annihilation of captured WIMPs in the stellar core may be comparable to or even
exceed the luminosity of the star due to thermonuclear burning. The model thus
predicts the existence of unusual stars, i.e. ""WIMP burners"", in the vicinity
of an adiabatically grown SMBH. We find that the most efficient WIMP burners
are stars with degenerate electron cores, e.g. white dwarfs (WD) or degenerate
cores with envelopes. If found, such stars would provide evidence for the
existence of particle dark matter and could possibly be used to establish its
density profile. In our previous paper we computed the luminosity from WIMP
burning for a range of dark matter spike density profiles, degenerate core
masses, and distances from the SMBH. Here we compare our results with the
observed stars closest to the Galactic center and find that they could be
consistent with WIMP burners in the form of degenerate cores with envelopes. We
also cross-check the WIMP burner hypothesis with the EGRET observed flux of
gamma-rays from the Galactic center, which imposes a constraint on the dark
matter spike density profile and annihilation cross-section. We find that the
EGRET data is consistent with the WIMP burner hypothesis. New high precision

those with an orbital inclination near 90 degree, are of special interest to
derive physical properties of extrasolar planets. With the knowledge of the
host star's physical parameters, the planetary radius can be determined.
Combined with spectroscopic observations the mass and therefore the density can
be derived from Doppler-measurements. Depending on the brightness of the host
star, additional information, e. g. about the spin-orbit alignment between the
host star and planetary orbit, can be obtained.

Among other surveys, the MACHO project provided nine potential transiting
planets, several of them with relatively bright parent stars. The photometric
signature of a transit event is, however, insufficient to confirm the planetary
nature of the faint companion. The aim of this paper therefore is a

selected from the MACHO sample, which are consistent with transits of
low-luminosity objects. Radial velocities have been determined by means of
cross-correlation with model spectra. The MACHO light curves have been compared
to simulations based on the physical parameters of the system derived from the

What Can be Learned Studying the Distribution of the Biggest Fragment ?,"  In the canonical formalism of statistical physics, a signature of a first
order phase transition for finite systems is the bimodal distribution of an

behaviour of Z1. Getting rid of the entrance channel effects and under the

Reconstructing the Intrinsic Triaxial Shape of the Virgo Cluster,"  To use galaxy clusters as a cosmological probe, it is important to account
for their triaxiality. Assuming that the triaxial shapes of galaxy clusters are
induced by the tidal interaction with the surrounding matter, Lee and Kang
recently developed a reconstruction algorithm for the measurement of the axial
ratio of a triaxial cluster. We examine the validity of this reconstruction
algorithm by performing an observational test of it with the Virgo cluster as a
target. We first modify the LK06 algorithm by incorporating the two dimensional
projection effect. Then, we analyze the 1275 member galaxies from the Virgo
Cluster Catalogue and find the projected direction of the Virgo cluster major
axis by measuring the anisotropy in the spatial distribution of the member
galaxies in the two dimensional projected plane. Applying the modified
reconstruction algorithm to the analyzed data, we find that the axial ratio of
the triaxial Virgo cluster is (1: 0.54 : 0.73). This result is consistent with
the recent observational report from the Virgo Cluster Survey, proving the
robustness of the reconstruction algorithm. It is also found that at the inner
radii the shape tends to be more like prolate. We discuss the possible effect
of the Virgo cluster triaxiality on the mass estimation.

Euclidean analysis of the entropy functional formalism,"  The attractor mechanism implies that the supersymmetric black hole near
horizon solution is defined only in terms of the conserved charges and is
therefore independent of asymptotic moduli. Starting only with the near horizon
geometry, Sen's entropy functional formalism computes the entropy of an extreme
black hole by means of a Legendre transformation where the electric fields are
defined as conjugated variables to the electric charges. However, traditional
Euclidean methods require the knowledge of the full geometry to compute the
black hole thermodynamic quantities. We establish the connection between the
entropy functional formalism and the standard Euclidean formalism taken at zero
temperature. We find that Sen's entropy function 'f' (on-shell) matches the
zero temperature limit of the Euclidean action. Moreover, Sen's near horizon
angular and electric fields agree with the chemical potentials that are defined

"The blue plume population in dwarf spheroidal galaxies: genuine blue
  stragglers or young stellar population?","  Abridged... Blue stragglers (BSS) are thought to be the product of either
primordial or collisional binary systems. In the context of dwarf spheroidal
galaxies it is hard to firmly disentangle a genuine BSS population from young
main sequence (MS) stars tracing a ~1-2 Gyr old star forming episode. Assuming
that their blue plume populations are made of BSS, we estimate the BSS
frequency for 8 Local Group non star-forming dwarf galaxies, using a
compilation of ground and space based photometry.
  Our results can be summarized as follows: (i) The BSS frequency in dwarf
galaxies, at any given Mv, is always higher than that in globular clusters of
similar luminosities; (ii) the BSS frequency for the lowest luminosity dwarf
galaxies is in excellent agreement with that observed in the Milky Way halo;
and most interestingly (iii) derive a statistically significant
anti-correlation between the BSS frequency and the galaxy Mv.
  The low density, almost collision-less, environments of our dwarf galaxy
sample allow us to infer (i) their very low dynamical evolution; (ii) a
negligible production of collisional BSS; and consequently (iii) that their
blue plumes are mainly made of primordial binaries. The dwarf galaxies
anti-correlation can be used as a discriminator: galaxies obeying the
anti-correlation are more likely to possess genuine primordial BSS rather than
young main sequence stars.

excitations in addition to the usual phonon modes. In order to investigate
their interplay on an elementary level we resort to various one-dimensional

coherent structure factor, which are extracted from molecular dynamics
simulations. For the validation of the algorithms, results for the harmonic
periodic chain are presented. We then study the Fibonacci chain with harmonic

neighboring atoms interact by double-well potentials allowing for phason flips.
The difference between the structure factors of the dynamic and the harmonic
Fibonacci chain lies in the temperature dependence of the phonon line width. If

A Better Good-Turing Estimator for Sequence Probabilities,"  We consider the problem of estimating the probability of an observed string
drawn i.i.d. from an unknown distribution. The key feature of our study is that
the length of the observed string is assumed to be of the same order as the
size of the underlying alphabet. In this setting, many letters are unseen and
the empirical distribution tends to overestimate the probability of the
observed letters. To overcome this problem, the traditional approach to
probability estimation is to use the classical Good-Turing estimator. We
introduce a natural scaling model and use it to show that the Good-Turing
sequence probability estimator is not consistent. We then introduce a novel

Chaos and Symmetry in String Cosmology,"  We review the recently discovered interplay between chaos and symmetry in the
general inhomogeneous solution of many string-related Einstein-matter systems

billiard chambers describing the asymptotic cosmological behaviour of pure
Einstein gravity in spacetime dimension d+1, or the metric-three-form system of
11-dimensional supergravity, are found to be identical to the Weyl chambers of
the Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebras AE_d, or E_{10}, respectively. This suggests
that these Kac-Moody algebras are hidden symmetries of the corresponding
models. There even exists some evidence of a hidden equivalence between the
general solution of the Einstein-three-form system and a null geodesic in the

"Sparse Estimators and the Oracle Property, or the Return of Hodges'
  Estimator","  We point out some pitfalls related to the concept of an oracle property as
used in Fan and Li (2001, 2002, 2004) which are reminiscent of the well-known
pitfalls related to Hodges' estimator. The oracle property is often a
consequence of sparsity of an estimator. We show that any estimator satisfying
a sparsity property has maximal risk that converges to the supremum of the loss
function; in particular, the maximal risk diverges to infinity whenever the
loss function is unbounded. For ease of presentation the result is set in the
framework of a linear regression model, but generalizes far beyond that
setting. In a Monte Carlo study we also assess the extent of the problem in
finite samples for the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) estimator
introduced in Fan and Li (2001). We find that this estimator can perform rather
poorly in finite samples and that its worst-case performance relative to
maximum likelihood deteriorates with increasing sample size when the estimator
is tuned to sparsity.

Deciphering top flavor violation at the LHC with B factories,"  The LHC will have unprecedented sensitivity to flavor-changing neutral

A Diagrammatic Category for the Representation Theory of U_q(sl_n),"  This thesis provides a partial answer to a question posed by Greg Kuperberg
in q-alg/9712003 and again by Justin Roberts as problem 12.18 in ""Problems on
invariants of knots and 3-manifolds"", math.GT/0406190, essentially: ""Can one
describe the category of representations of the quantum group U_q(sl_n)
(thought of as a spherical category) via generators and relations?""
  For each n \geq 0, I define a certain tensor category of trivalent graphs,
modulo isotopy, and construct a functor from this category onto (a full
subcategory of) the category of representations of the quantum group U_q(sl_n).
One would like to describe completely the kernel of this functor, by providing
generators. The resulting quotient of the diagrammatic category would then be a
category equivalent to the representation category of U_q(sl_n).
  I make significant progress towards this, describing certain generators of
the kernel, and some obstructions to further elements. It remains a conjecture
that these relations generate the kernel. My results extend those of
q-alg/9712003, MR1659228, math.QA/0310143 and math.GT/0506403.
  The argument is essentially by constructing a diagrammatic version of the
forgetful functor coming from the inclusion of U_q(sl_{n-1}) in U_q(sl_n}. We
know this functor is faithful, so a diagram is in the kernel for n exactly if
its image under the diagrammatic forgetful functor is in the kernel for n-1.
This allows us to perform inductive calculations, both establishing families of
elements of the kernel, and finding obstructions.

HST/ACS Coronagraphic Observations of the Dust Surrounding HD 100546,"  We present ACS/HST coronagraphic observations of HD 100546, a B9.5 star, 103
pc away from the sun, taken in the F435W, F606W, and F814W bands. Scattered
light is detected up to 14'' from the star. The observations are consistent
with the presence of an extended flattened nebula with the same inclination as
the inner disk. The well-known ``spiral arms'' are clearly observed and they
trail the rotating disk material. Weaker arms never before reported are also
seen. The inter-arm space becomes brighter, but the structures become more
neutral in color at longer wavelengths, which is not consistent with models
that assume that they are due to the effects of a warped disk. Along the major
disk axis, the colors of the scattered-light relative to the star are \Delta
(F435W-F606W) ~ 0.0--0.2 mags and \Delta (F435W-F814W)~0.5--1 mags. To explain
these colors, we explore the role of asymmetric scattering, reddening, and
large minimum sizes on ISM-like grains. We conclude each of these hypotheses by
itself cannot explain the colors. The disk colors are similar to those derived
for Kuiper Belt objects, suggesting that the same processes responsible for
their colors may be at work here. We argue that we are observing only the
geometrically thick, optically thin envelope of the disk, while the optically
thick disk responsible for the far-IR emission is undetected. The observed
spiral arms are then structures on this envelope. The colors indicate that the

"Gauge Invariant Factorisation and Canonical Quantisation of

Towards Functional Flows for Hierarchical Models,"This research paper explores the concept of functional flows in hierarchical models. Hierarchical models are used in various fields, such as biology, economics, and engineering, to represent complex systems. However, the traditional approach to hierarchical modeling relies on a top-down approach, where the system is decomposed into smaller modules, and each module is modeled independently. This approach can lead to a loss of information and oversimplification of the system. Functional flows offer a new approach to hierarchical modeling, where the focus is on the interactions and dependencies between the modules rather than their individual behavior. This paper presents a framework for developing functional flows in hierarchical models and shows how it can be applied to a case study in ecology. The results demonstrate that functional flows can lead to a more accurate representation of the system and provide insights into the dynamics of the system that were not apparent with the traditional approach.

which are viewed at an oblique angle with respect to the accretion column. The
resulting line profiles are most sensitive to the inclination angle. We have

Critical Current of Type-II Superconductors in a Broken Bose Glass State,"  The tilt modulus of a defective Abrikosov vortex lattice pinned by material

length. The critical current is predicted to crossover from two dimensional to
three dimensional behavior as a function of sample thickness along the
correlated pinning centers in such case. That crossover notably can occur at a

setting which permits to deduce geometric integrators for continuous
nonholonomic systems (reduced or not). The formalism is given in terms of Lie
groupoids, specifying a discrete Lagrangian and a constraint submanifold on it.
Additionally, it is necessary to fix a vector subbundle of the Lie algebroid
associated to the Lie groupoid. We also discuss the existence of nonholonomic
evolution operators in terms of the discrete nonholonomic Legendre
transformations and in terms of adequate decompositions of the prolongation of
the Lie groupoid. The characterization of the reversibility of the evolution
operator and the discrete nonholonomic momentum equation are also considered.
Finally, we illustrate with several classical examples the wide range of
application of the theory (the discrete nonholonomic constrained particle, the
Suslov system, the Chaplygin sleigh, the Veselova system, the rolling ball on a
rotating table and the two wheeled planar mobile robot).

Pseudogap and charge density waves in two dimensions,"  An interaction between electrons and lattice vibrations (phonons) results in
two fundamental quantum phenomena in solids: in three dimensions it can turn a
metal into a superconductor whereas in one dimension it can turn a metal into
an insulator. In two dimensions (2D) both superconductivity and charge-density
waves (CDW) are believed to be anomalous. In superconducting cuprates, critical
transition temperatures are unusually high and the energy gap may stay unclosed
even above these temperatures (pseudogap). In CDW-bearing dichalcogenides the
resistivity below the transition can decrease with temperature even faster than
in the normal phase and a basic prerequisite for the CDW, the favourable
nesting conditions (when some sections of the Fermi surface appear shifted by
the same vector), seems to be absent. Notwithstanding the existence of
alternatives to conventional theories, both phenomena in 2D still remain the
most fascinating puzzles in condensed matter physics. Using the latest
developments in high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) here we show that the normal-state pseudogap also exists in one of the
most studied 2D examples, dichalcogenide 2H-TaSe2, and the formation of CDW is
driven by a conventional nesting instability, which is masked by the pseudogap.
Our findings reconcile and explain a number of unusual, as previously believed,
experimental responses as well as disprove many alternative theoretical
approaches. The magnitude, character and anisotropy of the 2D-CDW pseudogap are
intriguingly similar to those seen in superconducting cuprates.

Optimal flexibility for conformational transitions in macromolecules,"  Conformational transitions in macromolecular complexes often involve the
reorientation of lever-like structures. Using a simple theoretical model, we
show that the rate of such transitions is drastically enhanced if the lever is
bendable, e.g. at a localized ""hinge''. Surprisingly, the transition is fastest
with an intermediate flexibility of the hinge. In this intermediate regime, the
transition rate is also least sensitive to the amount of ""cargo'' attached to
the lever arm, which could be exploited by molecular motors. To explain this
effect, we generalize the Kramers-Langer theory for multi-dimensional barrier
crossing to configuration dependent mobility matrices.

Quantum Zeno Effect in the Decoherent Histories,"  The quantum Zeno effect arises due to frequent observation. That implies the

"Green function theory versus Quantum Monte Carlo calculations for thin

systems, i.e. systems for which the anisotropy favors a magnetization parallel
to the film plane. We discuss these systems in perpendicular external field,
i.e. B parallel to the film normal. GFT results are in good agreement with QMC
for high enough fields and temperatures. Below a critical field or a critical
temperature no collinear stable magnetization exists in GFT. On the other hand
QMC gives finite magnetization even below those critical values. This indicates
that there occurs a transition from non-collinear to collinear configurations
with increasing field or temperature. For slightly tilted external fields a
rotation of magnetization from out-of-plane to in-plane orientation is found

"The effect of the solar corona on the attenuation of small-amplitude
  prominence oscillations. I. Longitudinal magnetic field","  Context. One of the typical features shown by observations of solar
prominence oscillations is that they are damped in time and that the values of
the damping times are usually between one and three times the corresponding
oscillatory period. However, the mechanism responsible for the attenuation is
still not well-known. Aims. Thermal conduction, optically thin or thick
radiation and heating are taken into account in the energy equation, and their
role on the attenuation of prominence oscillations is evaluated. Methods. The
dispersion relation for linear non-adiabatic magnetoacoustic waves is derived
considering an equilibrium made of a prominence plasma slab embedded in an
unbounded corona. The magnetic field is orientated along the direction parallel
to the slab axis and has the same strength in all regions. By solving the
dispersion relation for a fixed wavenumber, a complex oscillatory frequency is
obtained, and the period and the damping time are computed. Results. The effect
of conduction and radiation losses is different for each magnetoacoustic mode
and depends on the wavenumber. In the observed range of wavelengths the
internal slow mode is attenuated by radiation from the prominence plasma, the
fast mode by the combination of prominence radiation and coronal conduction and
the external slow mode by coronal conduction. The consideration of the external
corona is of paramount importance in the case of the fast and external slow
modes, whereas it does not affect the internal slow modes at all. Conclusions.
Non-adiabatic effects are efficient damping mechanisms for magnetoacoustic
modes, and the values of the obtained damping times are compatible with those

Moreover, boolean circuits have a representation in terms of elements of a
Thompson group, in such a way that circuit size is polynomially equivalent to
word-length. We show that circuits built with gates that are not constrained to
have fixed-length inputs and outputs, are at most quadratically more compact
than circuits built from traditional gates (with fixed-length inputs and
outputs). Finally, we show that the computational asymmetry function is closely
related to certain distortion functions: The computational asymmetry function
is polynomially equivalent to the distortion of the path length in Schreier
graphs of certain Thompson groups, compared to the path length in Cayley graphs

"Can One Estimate The Unconditional Distribution of Post-Model-Selection
  Estimators?","  We consider the problem of estimating the unconditional distribution of a
post-model-selection estimator. The notion of a post-model-selection estimator
here refers to the combined procedure resulting from first selecting a model
(e.g., by a model selection criterion like AIC or by a hypothesis testing
procedure) and then estimating the parameters in the selected model (e.g., by
least-squares or maximum likelihood), all based on the same data set. We show
that it is impossible to estimate the unconditional distribution with
reasonable accuracy even asymptotically. In particular, we show that no
estimator for this distribution can be uniformly consistent (not even locally).
This follows as a corollary to (local) minimax lower bounds on the performance
of estimators for the distribution; performance is here measured by the
probability that the estimation error exceeds a given threshold. These lower
bounds are shown to approach 1/2 or even 1 in large samples, depending on the
situation considered. Similar impossibility results are also obtained for the
distribution of linear functions (e.g., predictors) of the post-model-selection
estimator.
