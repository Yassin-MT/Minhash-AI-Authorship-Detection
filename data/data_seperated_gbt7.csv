"The contact process in disordered and periodic binary two-dimensional
  lattices","  The critical behavior of the contact process in disordered and periodic
binary 2d-lattices is investigated numerically by means of Monte Carlo
simulations as well as via an analytical approximation and standard mean field
theory. Phase-separation lines calculated numerically are found to agree well
with analytical predictions around the homogeneous point. For the disordered
case, values of static scaling exponents obtained via quasi-stationary
simulations are found to change with disorder strength. In particular, the
finite-size scaling exponent of the density of infected sites approaches a
value consistent with the existence of an infinite-randomness fixed point as
conjectured before for the 2d disordered CP. At the same time, both dynamical
and static scaling exponents are found to coincide with the values established
for the homogeneous case thus confirming that the contact process in a
heterogeneous environment belongs to the directed percolation universality
class.

The study explores the critical behavior of the contact process in these lattices and identifies the presence of a phase transition.

Additionally, the study identifies the critical exponents that govern the phase transition and highlights the impact of the initial infection density on the process's dynamics.

Beauty production using D* + mu and mu+ mu- correlations at ZEUS,"  Events with observed D* and/or muons in the final state were used to indicate
the presence of beauty quark production and to study the correlations between
the particles coming from the same or different B-hadrons. The Next-to-Leading
Order (NLO) theoretical predictions for such processes were often available
only at parton level. A method to calculate visible level cross sections at
NLO, based on an interface of the FMNR program to PYTHIA 6.2, is applied. It
uses the NLO description at b-quark level provided by FMNR applying a
statistical reduction procedure (REDSTAT) that allows the link to PYTHIA, from
where the description of the B-hadron decay chain is obtained. Comparisons of
the data and NLO cross sections at visible and b-quark level were found to be

Confining ensemble of dyons,"  We construct the integration measure over the moduli space of an arbitrary
number of N kinds of dyons of the pure SU(N) gauge theory at finite

described by a (supersymmetric) quantum field theory that is exactly solvable
and is remarkable for a number of striking features: 1) The free energy has the
minimum corresponding to the zero average Polyakov line, as expected in the
confining phase; 2)The correlation function of two Polyakov lines exhibits a
linear potential between static quarks in any N-ality non-zero representation,
with a calculable string tension roughly independent of temperature; 3) The
average spatial Wilson loop falls off exponentially with its area and the same
string tension; 4) At a critical temperature the ensemble of dyons rearranges

"The Ionization Fraction of Barnard 68: Implications for Star and Planet

pre-stellar core, using millimeter H13CO+ and DCO+ lines observations. These
observations are compared to the predictions of a radiative transfer model
coupled to a chemical network that includes depletion on grains and gas phase
deuterium fractionation. Together with previous observations and modelling of
CO and isotopologues, our H13CO+ and DCO+ observations and modelling allow to
place constraints on the metal abundance and the cosmic ionization rate. The
H13CO+ emission is well reproduced for metals abundances lower than 3e-9 and a
standard cosmic ray ionization rate. However, the observations are also
consistent with a complete depletion of metals, i.e. with cosmic rays as the
only source of ionization at visual extinctions greater than a few Av . The
DCO+ emission is found to be dependent of the ortho to para H2 ratio, and
indicates a ratio of ~1e-2. The derived ionization fraction is about 5e-9 with
respect to H nuclei, which is about an order of magnitude lower than the one
observed in the L1544 core. The corresponding ambipolar diffusion timescale is
found to be an order of magnitude larger than the free fall timescale at the
center of the core. The inferred metal abundance suggests that magnetically

MICS Asia Phase II - Sensitivity to the aerosol module,"  In the framework of the model inter-comparison study - Asia Phase II (MICS2),
where eight models are compared over East Asia, this paper studies the
influence of different parameterizations used in the aerosol module on the
aerosol concentrations of sulfate and nitrate in PM10. An intracomparison of
aerosol concentrations is done for March 2001 using different configurations of
the aerosol module of one of the model used for the intercomparison. Single
modifications of a reference setup for model configurations are performed and
compared to a reference case. These modifications concern the size
distribution, i.e. the number of sections, and physical processes, i.e.
coagulation, condensation/evaporation, cloud chemistry, heterogeneous reactions
and sea-salt emissions. Comparing monthly averaged concentrations at different
stations, the importance of each parameterization is first assessed. It is
found that sulfate concentrations are little sensitive to sea-salt emissions
and to whether condensation is computed dynamically or by assuming
thermodynamic equilibrium. Nitrate concentrations are little sensitive to cloud
chemistry. However, a very high sensitivity to heterogeneous reactions is
observed. Thereafter, the variability of the aerosol concentrations to the use
of different chemistry transport models (CTMs) and the variability to the use
of different parameterizations in the aerosol module are compared. For sulfate,
the variability to the use of different parameterizations in the aerosol module
is lower than the variability to the use of different CTMs. However, for
nitrate, for monthly averaged concentrations averaged over four stations, these
two variabilities have the same order of magnitude.

"Deriving temperature, mass and age of evolved stars from high-resolution
  spectra. Application to field stars and the open cluster IC 4651","  We test our capability of deriving stellar physical parameters of giant stars
by analysing a sample of field stars and the well studied open cluster IC 4651
with different spectroscopic methods. The use of a technique based on
line-depth ratios (LDRs) allows us to determine with high precision the
effective temperature of the stars and to compare the results with those
obtained with a classical LTE abundance analysis. (i) For the field stars we
find that the temperatures derived by means of the LDR method are in excellent
agreement with those found by the spectral synthesis. This result is extremely
encouraging because it shows that spectra can be used to firmly derive
population characteristics (e.g., mass and age) of the observed stars. (ii) For
the IC 4651 stars we use the determined effective temperature to derive the
following results. a) The reddening E(B-V) of the cluster is 0.12+/-0.02,
largely independent of the color-temperature calibration used. b) The age of
the cluster is 1.2+/-0.2 Gyr. c) The typical mass of the analysed giant stars

Particle Interpretations of the PVLAS Data,"  Recently the PVLAS collaboration reported the observation of a rotation of

particles. We discuss a class of models, involving, in addition to our familiar
``visible'' photon, further light ``hidden paraphotons'', which mix
kinematically with the visible one, and further light paracharged particles. In
these models, very strong astrophysical and cosmological bounds on the weakly

year, a number of decisive laboratory based tests of the particle
interpretation of the PVLAS anomaly will be done. More generally, such
experiments, exploiting high fluxes of low-energy photons and/or large

Particle Interpretations of the PVLAS Data,"Particle Interpretations of the PVLAS Data: Abstract

The PVLAS (Polarizzazione del Vuoto con Laser) experiment has provided intriguing results regarding the interaction of light with a magnetic field in a vacuum. The experiment has measured a rotation of the plane of polarization of a laser beam passing through a strong magnetic field in a vacuum, in contrast to the prediction of classical electrodynamics. The observed rotation has been interpreted as a manifestation of the production of light particles, such as axions or paraphotons, in the magnetic field. This paper reviews the experimental results and the theoretical interpretations of the PVLAS data, focusing on the particle interpretations. We discuss the properties of the hypothetical particles that could explain the observed effect, the constraints imposed by other experiments and observations, and the prospects for future tests of the particle interpretation. We also address some of the controversies and debates surrounding the interpretation of the PVLAS data, such as the role of other effects, the sensitivity of the experiment to systematic uncertainties, and the compatibility with other theoretical models. Our analysis suggests that the particle interpretations of the PVLAS data remain a viable and exciting possibility for the explanation of the observed effect, but further experimental and theoretical investigations are needed to confirm or refute this hypothesis.",2007-05-23,True

Renormalization and Effective Actions for General Relativity,"  Quantum gravity is analyzed from the viewpoint of the renormalization group.
The analysis is based on methods introduced by J. Polchinski concerning the
perturbative renormalization with flow equations. In the first part of this
work, the program of renormalization with flow equations is reviewed and then
extended to effective field theories that have a finite UV cutoff. This is done
for a scalar field theory by imposing additional renormalization conditions for
some of the nonrenormalizable couplings. It turns out that one so obtains a
statement on the predictivity of the effective theory at scales far below the
UV cutoff. In particular, nonrenormalizable theories can be treated without
problems in the proposed framework. In the second part, the standard covariant
BRS quantization program for Euclidean Einstein gravity is applied. A momentum
cutoff regularization is imposed and the resulting violation of the
Slavnov-Taylor identities is discussed. Deriving Polchinski's renormalization
group equation for Euclidean quantum gravity, the predictivity of effective
quantum gravity at scales far below the Planck scale is investigated with flow
equations. A fine-tuning procedure for restoring the violated Slavnov-Taylor
identities is proposed and it is argued that in the effective quantum gravity
context, the restoration will only be accomplished with finite accuracy.
Finally, the no-cutoff limit of Euclidean quantum gravity is analyzed from the
viewpoint of the Polchinski method. It is speculated whether a limit with
nonvanishing gravitational constant might exist where the latter would
ultimatively be determined by the cosmological constant and the masses of the
elementary particles.

Renormalization and Effective Actions for General Relativity,"The research paper titled ""Renormalization and Effective Actions for General Relativity"" focuses on the concept of renormalization in the context of general relativity. The authors explore the use of effective actions to describe the dynamics of gravity and the quantization of the gravitational field. They develop a systematic renormalization procedure for the effective action, which allows for the calculation of physical observables in a way that is consistent with the principles of quantum field theory.

The paper presents several key results and conclusions. One important result is the derivation of the renormalization group equation for the effective action, which describes how the effective action changes as the energy scale of the system is varied. The authors show that this equation can be used to derive the beta function for the gravitational coupling constant, which is a crucial parameter in the theory of gravity.

Another key result is the calculation of the effective action for a non-minimally coupled scalar field in curved spacetime. The authors show that the effective action can be written in terms of a series of curvature invariants, which provides a useful tool for analyzing the behavior of the scalar field in the presence of gravity.

  relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and magnetodynamics","  We present a new numerical code, ECHO, based on an Eulerian Conservative High
Order scheme for time dependent three-dimensional general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) and magnetodynamics (GRMD). ECHO is aimed at
providing a shock-capturing conservative method able to work at an arbitrary
level of formal accuracy (for smooth flows), where the other existing GRMHD and
GRMD schemes yield an overall second order at most. Moreover, our goal is to
present a general framework, based on the 3+1 Eulerian formalism, allowing for
different sets of equations, different algorithms, and working in a generic
space-time metric, so that ECHO may be easily coupled to any solver for
Einstein's equations. Various high order reconstruction methods are implemented
and a two-wave approximate Riemann solver is used. The induction equation is
treated by adopting the Upwind Constrained Transport (UCT) procedures,
appropriate to preserve the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field in
shock-capturing methods. The limiting case of magnetodynamics (also known as
force-free degenerate electrodynamics) is implemented by simply replacing the
fluid velocity with the electromagnetic drift velocity and by neglecting the
matter contribution to the stress tensor. ECHO is particularly accurate,
efficient, versatile, and robust. It has been tested against several

  grains","  We study the magnetohydrostatic equilibrium of magnetic flux tubes with
circular cross sections embedded in a magnetic surrounding atmosphere. We solve
the static momentum equation in 2.5D to obtain the thermodynamics that are
consistent with a prescribed velocity and magnetic fields. We show that force
balance is roughly satisfied if the flux tube's magnetic field is aligned with
its axis. Equilibrium is guaranteed if this magnetic field possesses a
transverse component. Several forms of this transverse field are investigated.
The resulting magnetic field configurations are critically reviewed in terms of
the results from spectropolarimetric observations. The thermodynamic structure
that allows the flux tube to be in mechanical equilibrium is also calculated.
We show that the inferred pressure, density and temperature stratification
reproduce intensity features similar to dark core penumbral filaments and
penumbral grains.

Multiple pattern matching: A Markov chain approach,"  RNA motifs typically consist of short, modular patterns that include base
pairs formed within and between modules. Estimating the abundance of these
patterns is of fundamental importance for assessing the statistical
significance of matches in genomewide searches, and for predicting whether a
given function has evolved many times in different species or arose from a
single common ancestor. In this manuscript, we review in an integrated and
self-contained manner some basic concepts of automata theory, generating
functions and transfer matrix methods that are relevant to pattern analysis in
biological sequences. We formalize, in a general framework, the concept of
Markov chain embedding to analyze patterns in random strings produced by a
memoryless source. This conceptualization, together with the capability of
automata to recognize complicated patterns, allows a systematic analysis of
problems related to the occurrence and frequency of patterns in random strings.
The applications we present focus on the concept of synchronization of
automata, as well as automata used to search for a finite number of keywords

Coupling of transverse and longitudinal response in stiff polymers,"  The time-dependent transverse response of stiff polymers, represented as
weakly-bending wormlike chains (WLCs), is well-understood on the linear level,
where transverse degrees of freedom evolve independently from the longitudinal
ones. We show that, beyond a characteristic time scale, the nonlinear coupling
of transverse and longitudinal motion in an inextensible WLC significantly
weakens the polymer response compared to the widely used linear response
predictions. The corresponding feedback mechanism is rationalized by scaling
arguments and quantified by a multiple scale approach that exploits an inherent
separation of transverse and longitudinal correlation length scales. Crossover
scaling laws and exact analytical and numerical solutions for characteristic
response quantities are derived for different experimentally relevant setups.
Our findings are applicable to cytoskeletal filaments as well as DNA under
tension.

"Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients: A common behaviour or a class of
  objects?","  INTEGRAL monitoring of the Galactic Plane is revealing a growing number of
recurrent X-ray transients, characterised by short outbursts with very fast
rise times (~ tens of minutes) and typical durations of a few hours. A
substantial fraction of these sources are associated with OB supergiants and
hence define a new class of massive X-ray binaries, which we call Supergiant
Fast X-ray Transients. Characterisation of the astrophysical parameters of
their counterparts is underway. So far, we have found a number of late O and
early B supergiants of different luminosities at a large range of distances.
Nothing in their optical properties sets them apart from classical Supergiant
X-ray Binaries. On the other hand, there is now rather concluding evidence that
persistent supergiant X-ray binaries also show fast outbursts. This suggests a
continuum of behaviours between typical persistent supergiant systems and
purely transient systems, but offers very little information about the physical

traffic present periodic behavior whereas the UDP traffic is stationary and
lead to long- range depedency characteristics. For all the applications, the

"Absolute Galois acts faithfully on the components of the moduli space of

higher-dimensional analogue: does the absolute Galois group act faithfully on
the deformation equivalence classes of smooth surfaces? (These equivalence
classes are of course by definition the strongest deformation invariants.) We
give a short proof of a weaker result: the absolute Galois group acts
faithfully on the irreducible components of the moduli space of smooth surfaces

"A ""diamond-ring"" star: the unusual morphologic structure of a young
  (multiple?) object","  We have observed IRAS06468-0325 obtaining optical and infrared images through
IJHKs and L' filters, K-band low-resolution spectroscopy, together with
millimetre line observations of CO and CS. IRAS06468-0325 has a very unusual
and enigmatic morphology with two components: a bright, close to point-like
source (the diamond) and a sharp-edge ring-like structure (the ring). The
source is not detected in the optical, at wavelengths shorter than the I-band.
The diamond is seen in all the imaging bands observed. The ring-like structure
in IRAS06468-0325 is clearly seen in the I, J, H, and Ks. It is not detected in
the L'-band image. Infrared colours of the diamond are compatible with excess
circumstellar emission and a young stellar nature. A strongly non-gaussian and
moderately bright CO(1-0) and {13}CO(2-1) lines are seen towards
IRAS06468-0325, at v_{LSR} of 30.5 km s{-1} (corresponding to a kinematic
distance of 3 kpc). Very weak C{18}O(2-1) and CS(2-1) lines were detected.
K-band spectra of the diamond and of the ring are similar both in the slope of
the continuum and in the presence of lines supporting the idea that the ring is

to a young stellar multiple system in a transient stage where a binary
co-exists with a circumbinary disc, similar to the case of GG Tau. In this
case, the sharpness of the well-defined ring may be due to tidal truncation
from dynamic interactions between components in a binary or multiple stellar
system. IRAS06468-0325 may be an important rare case that illustrates a

"Millimeter dust continuum emission unveiling the true mass of giant
  molecular clouds in the Small Magellanic Cloud","  CO observations have been so far the best way to trace molecular gas in
external galaxies, but at low metallicity the gas mass deduced could be largely
underestimated. At present, the kinematic information of CO data cubes are used
to estimate virial masses and trace the total mass of the molecular clouds.
Millimeter dust emission can also be used as a dense gas tracer and could
unveil H2 envelopes lacking CO. These different tracers must be compared in
different environments. This study compares virial masses to masses deduced
from millimeter emission, in two GMC samples: the local molecular clouds in our
Galaxy and their equivalents in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), one of the
nearest low metallicity dwarf galaxy. In our Galaxy, mass estimates deduced
from millimeter emission are consistent with masses deduced from gamma ray
analysis and trace the total mass of the clouds. Virial masses are
systematically larger (twice on average) than mass estimates from millimeter
dust emission. This difference decreases toward high masses and has already
been reported in previous studies. In the SMC however, molecular cloud masses
deduced from SIMBA millimeter observations are systematically higher (twice on
average for conservative values of the dust to gas ratio and dust emissivity)
than the virial masses from SEST CO observations. The observed excess can not
be accounted for by any plausible change of dust properties. Taking a general
form for the virial theorem, we show that a magnetic field strength of ~15
micro Gauss in SMC clouds could provide additional support to the clouds and
explain the difference observed. Masses of SMC molecular clouds have therefore
been underestimated so far. Magnetic pressure may contribute significantly to
their support.

thickness necessary to achieve deconvolution. We modeled non-Debye impedance
response using Gaussian distributions of relaxation times and reveal that
conventional resistivity measurements on multiferroic layers may be dominated

night-side temperature is a strong indicator of the opacity of the planetary
atmosphere. Planetary atmospheres that maintain large, interstellar opacities
will exhibit large day-night temperature differences, while planets with
reduced atmospheric opacities due to extensive grain growth and sedimentation

Inflationary cosmology proposes that the early universe underwent a period of exponential expansion, which can explain the observed uniformity and flatness of the universe.

A generic mechanism for adaptive growth rate regulation,"  How can a microorganism adapt to a variety of environmental conditions
despite there exists a limited number of signal transduction machineries? We
show that for any growing cells whose gene expression is under stochastic
fluctuations, adaptive cellular state is inevitably selected by noise, even
without specific signal transduction network for it. In general, changes in
protein concentration in a cell are given by its synthesis minus dilution and
degradation, both of which are proportional to the rate of cell growth. In an
adaptive state with a higher growth speed, both terms are large and balanced.
Under the presence of noise in gene expression, the adaptive state is less
affected by stochasticity since both the synthesis and dilution terms are
large, while for a non-adaptive state both the terms are smaller so that cells
are easily kicked out of the original state by noise. Hence, escape time from a
cellular state and the cellular growth rate are negatively correlated. This
leads to a selection of adaptive states with higher growth rates, and model
simulations confirm this selection to take place in general. The results
suggest a general form of adaptation that has never been brought to light - a
process that requires no specific machineries for sensory adaptation. The
present scheme may help explain a wide range of cellular adaptive responses

Although simplistic, our analysis provides original results and new constraints

to determine a narrow range of temperature where the observed extreme
abundances of all light elements and isotopes in NGC6752 are nicely reproduced
simultaneously. This agreement is obtained after mixing of the H-processed
material with 30 % of unprocessed gas. The observed C-N, O-Na, Mg-Al, Li-Na and
F-Na anticorrelations, as well as the behaviour of the Mg isotopes can be
recovered by assuming mixing with even larger dilution factors. Li production
by the stars that build up the other abundance anomalies is not mandatory in

"Theory of weakly damped free-surface flows: a new formulation based on
  potential flow solutions","  Several theories for weakly damped free-surface flows have been formulated.
In this paper we use the linear approximation to the Navier-Stokes equations to
derive a new set of equations for potential flow which include dissipation due
to viscosity. A viscous correction is added not only to the irrotational
pressure (Bernoulli's equation), but also to the kinematic boundary condition.
The nonlinear Schr\""odinger (NLS) equation that one can derive from the new set
of equations to describe the modulations of weakly nonlinear, weakly damped
deep-water gravity waves turns out to be the classical damped version of the
NLS equation that has been used by many authors without rigorous justification.

Symbolic sensors,"Abstract: 

The concept of symbolic sensors has gained increasing attention in recent years, as it offers a promising approach to bridge the gap between physical sensors and high-level symbolic reasoning. Symbolic sensors are a class of sensors that can extract and represent symbolic information from the physical world, going beyond traditional sensors that provide numerical measurements. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in symbolic sensors, including their theoretical foundations, design principles, and applications. We discuss various types of symbolic sensors, such as vision-based sensors, language-based sensors, and gesture-based sensors, and highlight their strengths and limitations. We also explore how symbolic sensors can be integrated with machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to enable more intelligent and context-aware systems. Finally, we identify some key research challenges and future directions in the field of symbolic sensors, such as developing more efficient and robust algorithms for symbolic information extraction, improving the interpretability and explainability of symbolic sensor outputs, and exploring new applications in domains such as robotics, healthcare, and smart cities.",2007-05-23,True

"A double main sequence turn-off in the rich star cluster NGC 1846 in the
  Large Magellanic Cloud","  We report on HST/ACS photometry of the rich intermediate-age star cluster NGC
1846 in the Large Magellanic Cloud, which clearly reveals the presence of a
double main sequence turn-off in this object. Despite this, the main sequence,
sub-giant branch, and red giant branch are all narrow and well-defined, and the
red clump is compact. We examine the spatial distribution of turn-off stars and
demonstrate that all belong to NGC 1846 rather than to any field star
population. In addition, the spatial distributions of the two sets of turn-off
stars may exhibit different central concentrations and some asymmetries. By
fitting isochrones, we show that the properties of the colour-magnitude diagram
can be explained if there are two stellar populations of equivalent metal
abundance in NGC 1846, differing in age by approximately 300 Myr. The absolute
ages of the two populations are ~1.9 and ~2.2 Gyr, although there may be a
systematic error of up to +/-0.4 Gyr in these values. The metal abundance
inferred from isochrone fitting is [M/H] ~ -0.40, consistent with spectroscopic
measurements of [Fe/H]. We propose that the observed properties of NGC 1846 can
be explained if this object originated via the tidal capture of two star
clusters formed separately in a star cluster group in a single giant molecular
cloud. This scenario accounts naturally for the age difference and uniform
metallicity of the two member populations, as well as the differences in their

"Wang-Landau molecular dynamics technique to search for low-energy

Wang and Landau developed a convenient method for estimating the density of

MD simulations. In the multicanonical MD, the estimation of the derivative of
the density of states is critical. In order to estimate it accurately, we
devise two original improvements. First, the correction for the density of
states is made smooth by using the Gaussian distribution obtained by a short
canonical simulation. Second, an approximation is applied to the derivative,
which is based on the Gaussian distribution and the multiple weighted histogram
technique. A test of this method was performed with small polypeptides,

Random walks of Wilson loops in the screening regime,"  Dynamics of Wilson loops in pure Yang-Mills theories is analyzed in terms of

"Cooperative Transmission Protocols with High Spectral Efficiency and
  High Diversity Order Using Multiuser Detection and Network Coding","  Cooperative transmission is an emerging communication technique that takes
advantages of the broadcast nature of wireless channels. However, due to low
spectral efficiency and the requirement of orthogonal channels, its potential
for use in future wireless networks is limited. In this paper, by making use of
multiuser detection (MUD) and network coding, cooperative transmission
protocols with high spectral efficiency, diversity order, and coding gain are
developed. Compared with the traditional cooperative transmission protocols
with single-user detection, in which the diversity gain is only for one source
user, the proposed MUD cooperative transmission protocols have the merits that
the improvement of one user's link can also benefit the other users. In
addition, using MUD at the relay provides an environment in which network
coding can be employed. The coding gain and high diversity order can be
obtained by fully utilizing the link between the relay and the destination.
  From the analysis and simulation results, it is seen that the proposed

"On sensing capacity of sensor networks for the class of linear

sensor networks for a class of linear observation models and a fixed SNR
regime. Sensing capacity is defined as the maximum number of signal dimensions
reliably identified per sensor observation. In this context sparsity of the
phenomena is a key feature that determines sensing capacity. Precluding the SNR
of the environment the effect of sparsity on the number of measurements
required for accurate reconstruction of a sparse phenomena has been widely
dealt with under compressed sensing. Nevertheless the development there was
motivated from an algorithmic perspective. In this paper our aim is to derive
these bounds in an information theoretic set-up and thus provide algorithm
independent conditions for reliable reconstruction of sparse signals. In this

the probability of error in reconstruction subject to an arbitrary distortion
criteria. Using these lower bounds to the probability of error, we derive upper
bounds to sensing capacity and show that for fixed SNR regime sensing capacity
goes down to zero as sparsity goes down to zero. This means that
disproportionately more sensors are required to monitor very sparse events. Our
next main contribution is that we show the effect of sensing diversity on
sensing capacity, an effect that has not been considered before. Sensing
diversity is related to the effective \emph{coverage} of a sensor with respect

Spontaneous chirality via long-range electrostatic forces,"  We consider a model for periodic patterns of charges constrained over a
cylindrical surface. In particular we focus on patterns of chiral helices,
achiral rings or vertical lamellae, with the constraint of global
electroneutrality. We study the dependence of the patterns' size and pitch
angle on the radius of the cylinder and salt concentration. We obtain a phase
diagram by using numerical and analytic techniques. For pure Coulomb
interactions, we find a ring phase for small radii and a chiral helical phase
for large radii. At a critical salt concentration, the characteristic domain
size diverges, resulting in macroscopic phase segregation of the components and
restoring chiral symmetry. We discuss possible consequences and generalizations

"Mesoscopic fluctuations of the supercurrent in diffusive Josephson

coupled to superconductors by tunnel barriers and a diffusive junction with
transparent normal--superconducting interfaces. The amplitude of current
fluctuations and the weak localization correction to the average current are
calculated as functions of the ratio between the superconducting gap and the
electron dwell energy, temperature, and superconducting phase difference across
the junction. Technically, fluctuations on top of the spatially inhomogeneous
proximity effect in the normal region are described by the replicated version

Black-body components in Gamma-Ray Bursts spectra?,"  We study 7 Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), detected both by the BATSE instrument,
on-board the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, and by the Wide Field Camera (WFC),

sizeable fraction of the bursts defining the correlation between the peak
energy E_peak (i.e. the peak of the vFv spectrum) and the total prompt
isotropic energy E_iso (the so called ""Amati"" relation). Recent theoretical
interpretations of this correlation assume that black-body emission dominates
the time resolved spectra of GRBs, even if, in the time integrated spectrum,
its presence may be hidden by the change of its temperature and by the dilution
of a possible non-thermal power law component. We perform a time resolved
spectral analysis, and show that the sum of a power-law and a black-body gives
acceptable fits to the time dependent spectra within the BATSE energy range,
but overpredicts the flux in the WFC X-ray range. Moreover, a fit with a cutoff
power-law plus a black-body is consistent with the WFC data, but the black-body
component contributes a negligible fraction of the total flux. On the contrary,
we find that fitting the spectra with a Band model or a simple cutoff power-law
model yields an X-ray flux and spectral slope which well matches the WFC

The symmetric heavy-light ansatz,"  The symmetric heavy-light ansatz is a method for finding the ground state of
any dilute unpolarized system of attractive two-component fermions.
Operationally it can be viewed as a generalization of the Kohn-Sham equations

original Hamiltonian has an exact Z_2 symmetry, the heavy-light ansatz breaks
this symmetry by skewing the mass ratio of the two components. In the limit
where one component is infinitely heavy, the many-body problem can be solved in
terms of single-particle orbitals. The original Z_2 symmetry is recovered by
enforcing Z_2 symmetry as a constraint on N-body density correlations for the
two components. For the 1D, 2D, and 3D attractive Hubbard models the method is
in very good agreement with exact Lanczos calculations for few-body systems at

Finite Euler products and the Riemann Hypothesis,"  We show that if the Riemann Hypothesis is true, then in a region containing
most of the right-half of the critical strip, the Riemann zeta-function is well
approximated by short truncations of its Euler product. Conversely, if the
approximation by products is good in this region, the zeta-function has at most
finitely many zeros in it. We then construct a parameterized family of
non-analytic functions with this same property. With the possible exception of
a finite number of zeros off the critical line, every function in the family
satisfies a Riemann Hypothesis. Moreover, when the parameter is not too large,
they have about the same number of zeros as the zeta-function, their zeros are
all simple, and they ""repel"". The structure of these functions makes the reason
for the simplicity and repulsion of their zeros apparent and suggests a
mechanism that might be responsible for the corresponding properties of the
zeta-function's zeros. Computer evidence suggests that the zeros of functions
in the family are remarkably close to those of the zeta-function (even for
small values of the parameter), and we show that they indeed converge to them
as the parameter increases. Furthermore, between zeros of the zeta-function,
the moduli of functions in the family tend to twice the modulus of the
zeta-function. Both assertions assume the Riemann Hypothesis. We end by
discussing analogues for other L-functions and show how they give insight into
the study of the distribution of zeros of linear combinations of L-functions.

GPCRs are a class of membrane proteins that play a crucial role in cellular signaling and are targeted by a large number of drugs. Due to their importance, there has been a significant effort to classify GPCRs into subfamilies based on their sequence and structural similarities. However, the current classification schemes have limitations, as they do not account for the dynamic nature of GPCRs and the fact that they can adopt different conformations. Our proposed adaptive strategy takes into account the conformational diversity of GPCRs and uses machine learning algorithms to classify them into subfamilies based on their functional properties. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to a dataset of GPCRs and comparing it with existing classification schemes.

Spectral methods for orthogonal rational functions,"  An operator theoretic approach to orthogonal rational functions on the unit
circle with poles in its exterior is presented in this paper. This approach is
based on the identification of a suitable matrix representation of the
multiplication operator associated with the corresponding orthogonality
measure. Two different alternatives are discussed, depending whether we use for
the matrix representation the standard basis of orthogonal rational functions,
or a new one with poles alternatively located in the exterior and the interior
of the unit circle. The corresponding representations are linear fractional
transformations with matrix coefficients acting respectively on Hessenberg and
five-diagonal unitary matrices.
  In consequence, the orthogonality measure can be recovered from the spectral
measure of an infinite unitary matrix depending uniquely on the poles and the
parameters of the recurrence relation for the orthogonal rational functions.
Besides, the zeros of the orthogonal and para-orthogonal rational functions are
identified as the eigenvalues of matrix linear fractional transformations of
finite Hessenberg and five-diagonal matrices.
  As an application of this operator approach, we obtain new relations between
the support of the orthogonality measure and the location of the poles and
parameters of the recurrence relation, generalizing to the rational case known
results for orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle.
  Finally, we extend these results to orthogonal polynomials on the real line

Searching for Lee-Wick Gauge Bosons at the LHC,"  In an extension of the Standard Model(SM) based on the ideas of Lee and Wick,

Transient X-ray Emission from Normal Galactic Nuclei,"  X-ray transients appeared in optically non-active galactic nuclei have been
observed in recent years. The most popular model explaining this kind of
phenomena is the conventional tidal disruption model. In this model, when a
star moves within the tidal radius of a black hole, part of the star materials
will fall into the black hole through an accretion disk, which gives rise to
the luminous flare. We propose that the X-ray emission may not necessarily come
from radiation of the accretion disk alone. Instead, it may be related to a
jet. As the jet travels in the interstellar medium, a shock is produced and
synchrotron radiation is expected. We compared the model light curve and the
synchrotron radiation spectrum with the observed data, and find that our model
explains the observed light curve and late-time spectrum well. Our model
predicts that these transient active galactic nuclei could be sources of the
future gamma-ray satellites, e.g. GLAST and the emission region will be
expanding with time.

"An iterative method to compute the sign function of a non-Hermitian
  matrix and its application to the overlap Dirac operator at nonzero chemical
  potential","  The overlap Dirac operator in lattice QCD requires the computation of the
sign function of a matrix. While this matrix is usually Hermitian, it becomes
non-Hermitian in the presence of a quark chemical potential. We show how the
action of the sign function of a non-Hermitian matrix on an arbitrary vector

subspace approximation based on the Arnoldi algorithm is described for the
evaluation of a generic matrix function. The efficiency of the method is
spoiled when the matrix has eigenvalues close to a function discontinuity. This
is cured by adding a small number of critical eigenvectors to the Krylov
subspace, for which we propose two different deflation schemes. The ensuing
modified Arnoldi method is then applied to the sign function, which has a
discontinuity along the imaginary axis. The numerical results clearly show the
improved efficiency of the method. Our modification is particularly effective

Dissipative dynamics of circuit-QED in the mesoscopic regime,"  We investigate the behavior of a circuit QED device when the resonator is

"New scaling relations in cluster radio halos and the re-acceleration
  model","  In this paper we derive new expected scaling relations for clusters with
giant radio halos in the framework of the re-acceleration scenario in a
simplified, but physically motivated, form, namely: radio power (P_R) vs size
of the radio emitting region (R_H), and P_R vs total cluster mass (M_H)
contained in the emitting region and cluster velocity dispersion (sigma_H) in
this region.
  We search for these correlations by analyzing the most recent radio and X-ray
data available in the literature for a well known sample of clusters with giant
radio halos. In particular we find a good correlation between P_R and R_H and a
very tight ``geometrical'' scaling between M_H and R_H. From these correlations
P_R is also expected to scale with M_H and sigma_H and this is confirmed by our
analysis. We show that all the observed trends can be well reconciled with
expectations in the case of a slight variation of the mean magnetic field
strength in the radio halo volume with M_H. A byproduct correlation between R_H
and sigma_H is also found, and can be further tested by optical studies. In
addition, we find that observationally R_H scales non-linearly with the virial
radius of the host cluster, and this immediately means that the fraction of the
cluster volume which is radio emitting increases with cluster mass and thus
that the non-thermal component in clusters is not self-similar.

Holes within galaxies: the egg or the hen?,"  Unsustained matter distributions unescapely collapse unless fragmentation and
centrifugal or pressure support take place. Starting from the above evidence,
supermassive compact objects at the centre of large-mass galaxies are conceived
as the end-product of the gravitational collapse of local density maxima around
which overdensities are located. At the beginning of evolution, local density
maxima are idealized as homogeneous peaks, while the surrounding envelopes are
described by a power-law density profile. The dependence of the density profile
on a second parameter, chosen to be the ratio between peak and total mass, is
analysed. Overdensity evolution is discussed in the context of quintessence
cosmological models and further investigation is devoted to a special case with
the aim to describe the central collapse. An empirical relation between hole
and dark halo mass is translated into a dependence of the fractional hole mass
on the overdensity mass. Computations are performed up to the end of central
collapse, and density profiles of related configurations are determined
together with additional parameters. The central collapse is completed in early
times, no longer than a few hundredths of Gyr, which implies hole formation
when proto-haloes, proto-bulges, and proto-disks are still expanding or
contracting. No appreciable change in evolution is found with regard to
different mean peak heights related to equal masses. On the other hand, it is
recognized that homogeneous peaks collapse ``faster'' with respect to
surroundings envelopes, in low-mass than in large-mass overdensities. In
conclusion, it is inferred that gravitational collapse of homogeneous peaks
within overdensities may be a viable mechanism for hole generation.

minimum. Here we use GEANT4 to simulate the charging process due to solar

exceeds the ASTROD I acceleration noise budget requirement. Continuous

paper opens up research regarding this issue by proposing a dynamic object
evaluation framework (DOEF). DOEF accomplishes access pattern change by
defining configurable styles of change. It is a preliminary prototype that has

algorithms. The results show that DOEF is effective at determining the
adaptability of each dynamic clustering algorithm to changes in access pattern.
They also led us to conclude that dynamic clustering algorithms can cope with
moderate levels of access pattern change, but that performance rapidly degrades
to be worse than no clustering when vigorous styles of access pattern change

  for Face Recognition","Face recognition is a widely researched topic, with neural networks (NNs) being one of the most effective methods for this task. In this paper, we compare the robustness of pairwise and multiclass NNs for face recognition. We evaluate the performance of both types of NNs on a large dataset of faces and compare their accuracy under various conditions, including changes in lighting, pose, and expression. Our results show that multiclass NNs outperform pairwise NNs in terms of accuracy and robustness, especially under challenging conditions. Furthermore, we find that multiclass NNs are more efficient in terms of memory and processing time, making them a better choice for real-time face recognition systems. These findings have implications for the development of more accurate and reliable face recognition systems using NNs.",2016-02-17,True
"Gamma-ray production in young open clusters: Berk 87, Cyg OB2 and
  Westerlund 2","  Young open clusters are likely sites of cosmic ray acceleration as indicated
by recent detections of the TeV gamma-ray sources in the directions of two open
clusters (Cyg OB2 and Westerlund 2) and their directional proximity to some
unidentified EGRET sources. In fact, up to now a few different scenarios for
acceleration of particles inside open clusters have been considered, i.e.
shocks in massive star winds, pulsars and their nebulae, supernova shocks,
massive compact binaries. Here we consider in detail the radiation processes
due to both electrons and hadrons accelerated inside the open cluster. As a
specific scenario, we apply the acceleration process at the shocks arising in
the winds of WR type stars. Particles diffuse through the medium of the open
cluster during the activity time of the acceleration scenario defined by the
age of the WR star. They interact with the matter and radiation, at first
inside the open cluster and, later in the dense surrounding clouds. We
calculate the broad band spectrum in different processes for three example open
clusters (Berk 87, Cyg OB2, Westerlund 2) for which the best observational
constraints on the spectra are at present available. It is assumed that the
high energy phenomena, observed from the X-ray up to the GeV-TeV gamma-ray
energies, are related to each other. We conclude that the most likely
description of the radiation processes in these objects is achieved in the
hybrid (leptonic-hadronic) model in which leptons are responsible for the
observed X-ray and GeV gamma-ray emission and hadrons are responsible for the
TeV gamma-ray emission, which is produced directly inside and in dense clouds
surrounding the open cluster.

"MgB2 single crystals substituted with Li and with Li-C: Structural and
  superconducting properties","  The effect of Li substitution for Mg and of Li-C co-substitution on the
superconducting properties and crystal structure of MgB2 single crystals has
been investigated. It has been found that hole doping with Li decreases the
superconducting transition temperature Tc, but at a slower rate than electron
doping with C or Al. Tc of MgB2 crystals with simultaneously substituted Li for
Mg and C for B decreases more than in the case where C is substituted alone.
This means that holes introduced by Li cannot counterbalance the effect of
decrease of Tc caused by introduction of electrons coming from C. The possible
reason of it can be that holes coming from Li occupy the pi band while
electrons coming from C fill the sigma band. The temperature dependences of the
upper critical field Hc2 for Al and Li substituted crystals with the same Tc
show a similar dHc2/dT slope at Tc and a similar Hc2(T) behavior, despite of
much different substitution level. This indicates that the mechanism
controlling Hc2 and Tc is similar in both hole and electron doped crystals.
Electrical transport measurements show an increase of resistivity both in Li
substituted crystals and in Li and C co-substituted crystals. This indicates
enhanced scattering due to defects introduced by substitutions including
distortion of the lattice. The observed behavior can be explained as a result
of two effects, influencing both Tc and Hc2. The first one is doping related to
the changes in the carrier concentration, which may lead to the decrease or to
the increase of Tc. The second one is related to the introduction of new
scattering centers leading to the modification of the interband and/or
intraband scattering and therefore, to changes in the superconducting gaps and
to the reduction of Tc.

"On Correlated Random Walks and 21-cm Fluctuations During Cosmic

analytical expression for the statistics of two correlated random walks has
been previously found only for the case of a constant barrier height. However,
calculating bubble sizes or accurate statistics for halo formation involves
more general barriers that can often be approximated as linear barriers. We

Inflationary Perturbations: the Cosmological Schwinger Effect,"  This pedagogical review aims at presenting the fundamental aspects of the
theory of inflationary cosmological perturbations of quantum-mechanical origin.
The analogy with the well-known Schwinger effect is discussed in detail and a
systematic comparison of the two physical phenomena is carried out. In
particular, it is demonstrated that the two underlying formalisms differ only
up to an irrelevant canonical transformation. Hence, the basic physical
mechanisms at play are similar in both cases and can be reduced to the
quantization of a parametric oscillator leading to particle creation due to the
interaction with a classical source: pair production in vacuum is therefore
equivalent to the appearance of a growing mode for the cosmological
fluctuations. The only difference lies in the nature of the source: an electric
field in the case of the Schwinger effect and the gravitational field in the
case of inflationary perturbations. Although, in the laboratory, it is
notoriously difficult to produce an electric field such that pairs extracted
from the vacuum can be detected, the gravitational field in the early universe
can be strong enough to lead to observable effects that ultimately reveal
themselves as temperature fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background.
Finally, the question of how quantum cosmological perturbations can be
considered as classical is discussed at the end of the article.

Modelling diffusional transport in the interphase cell nucleus,"  In this paper a lattice model for diffusional transport of particles in the
interphase cell nucleus is proposed. Dense networks of chromatin fibers are
created by three different methods: randomly distributed, non-interconnected
obstacles, a random walk chain model, and a self avoiding random walk chain
model with persistence length. By comparing a discrete and a continuous version
of the random walk chain model, we demonstrate that lattice discretization does
not alter particle diffusion. The influence of the 3D geometry of the fiber
network on the particle diffusion is investigated in detail, while varying
occupation volume, chain length, persistence length and walker size. It is
shown that adjacency of the monomers, the excluded volume effect incorporated
in the self avoiding random walk model, and, to a lesser extent, the
persistence length, affect particle diffusion. It is demonstrated how the
introduction of the effective chain occupancy, which is a convolution of the
geometric chain volume with the walker size, eliminates the conformational
effects of the network on the diffusion, i.e., when plotting the diffusion
coefficient as a function of the effective chain volume, the data fall onto a

"Cosmic-Ray Events as Background in Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov

"The subpulse modulation properties of pulsars at 92 cm and the frequency
  dependence of subpulse modulation","  A large sample of pulsars has been observed to study their subpulse
modulation at an observing wavelength (when achievable) of both 21 and 92 cm
using the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope. In this paper we present the
92-cm data and a comparison is made with the already published 21-cm results.
We analysed 191 pulsars at 92 cm using fluctuation spectra. The sample of
pulsars is as unbiased as possible towards any particular pulsar
characteristics. For 15 pulsars drifting subpulses are discovered for the first
time and 26 of the new drifters found in the 21-cm data are confirmed. We
discovered nulling for 8 sources and 8 pulsars are found to intermittently emit
single pulses that have pulse energies similar to giant pulses. It is estimated
that at least half of the total population of pulsars have drifting subpulses
when observations with a high enough signal-to-noise ratio would be available.
It could well be that the drifting subpulse mechanism is an intrinsic property
of the emission mechanism itself, although for some pulsars it is difficult or
impossible to detect. Drifting subpulses are in general found at both
frequencies, although the chance of detecting drifting subpulses is possibly
slightly higher at 92 cm. It appears that the youngest pulsars have the most
disordered subpulses and the subpulses become more and more organized into
drifting subpulses as the pulsar ages. The correlations with the modulation
indices are argued to be consistent with the picture in which the radio
emission can be divided in a drifting subpulse signal plus a quasi-steady
signal which becomes, on average, stronger at high observing frequencies. The
measured values of P3 at the two frequencies are highly correlated, but there
is no evidence for a correlation with other pulsar parameters.

Furthermore, the researchers found that the frequency dependence of subpulse modulation was not consistent across the sample of pulsars. This suggests that the underlying emission mechanisms for subpulse modulation may be complex and not easily explained by a single model. 

Overall, the paper's findings highlight the need for further research to better understand subpulse modulation and its relationship to pulsar emission mechanisms.",2009-11-13,True

"The evolution of interstellar clouds in a streaming hot plasma including
  heat conduction","  To examine the evolution of giant molecular clouds in the stream of a hot
plasma we performed two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations that take full
account of self-gravity, heating and cooling effects and heat conduction by
electrons. We use the thermal conductivity of a fully ionized hydrogen plasma
proposed by Spitzer and a saturated heat flux according to Cowie & McKee in
regions where the mean free path of the electrons is large compared to the
temperature scaleheight. Significant structural and evolutionary differences
occur between simulations with and without heat conduction. Dense clouds in
pure dynamical models experience dynamical destruction by Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH)
instability. In static models heat conduction leads to evaporation of such
clouds. Heat conduction acting on clouds in a gas stream smooths out steep
temperature and density gradients at the edge of the cloud because the
conduction timescale is shorter than the cooling timescale. This diminishes the
velocity gradient between the streaming plasma and the cloud, so that the
timescale for the onset of KH instabilities increases, and the surface of the
cloud becomes less susceptible to KH instabilities. The stabilisation effect of
heat conduction against KH instability is more pronounced for smaller and less
massive clouds. As in the static case more realistic cloud conditions allow
heat conduction to transfer hot material onto the cloud's surface and to mix
the accreted gas deeper into the cloud.

"Entanglement and topological entropy of the toric code at finite

code as a function of system size and temperature. We do so for systems with
infinite energy scale separation between magnetic and electric excitations, so
that the magnetic closed loop structure is fully preserved while the electric
loop structure is tampered with by thermally excited electric charges. We find
that the entanglement entropy is a singular function of temperature and system
size, and that the limit of zero temperature and the limit of infinite system
size do not commute. From the entanglement entropy we obtain the topological
entropy, which is shown to drop to half its zero-temperature value for any
infinitesimal temperature in the thermodynamic limit, and remains constant as
the temperature is further increased. Such discontinuous behavior is replaced
by a smooth decreasing function in finite-size systems. If the separation of
energy scales in the system is large but finite, we argue that our results hold
at small enough temperature and finite system size, and a second drop in the
topological entropy should occur as the temperature is raised so as to disrupt
the magnetic loop structure by allowing the appearance of free magnetic
charges. We interpret our results as an indication that the underlying magnetic
and electric closed loop structures contribute equally to the topological
entropy (and therefore to the topological order) in the system. Since each loop

creating an extremely valuable dataset for astronomers with a broad range of
scientific interests. Our goal is to investigate the nature of the near-UV
light in these objects, its relation to the circumnuclear starburst phenomenon,
and the connection of this to the evolution and growth of the galaxy bulge and
central black hole. In this paper, we describe the near-UV morphology of the
objects and characterize the near-UV emission. We estimate the size and the
luminosity of the emitting regions and extract the luminosity profile. We also
determine the presence of unresolved compact nuclei. In addition, the
circumnuclear stellar cluster population is identified, and the contribution of
the stellar clusters to the total light, at this wavelength, is estimated. The
size of the sample allows us to draw robust statistical conclusions. We find
that {Seyfert 1} galaxies are completely dominated by its bright and compact
nucleus, that remains point-like at this resolution, while we find almost no
unresolved nucleus in Seyfert 2. The Seyfert types 1 and 2 are quite segregated
in an asymmetry vs compactness plot. Stellar clusters are found somewhat more
frequently in Sy2 (in ~70% of the galaxies) than in Sy1 (~57%), and contribute
more to the total light in Sy2, but this two differences seem to be mostly due
to the large contribution of the compact nucleus in Sy1, as the luminosity
distribution of the clusters is similar in both Sy types.

Astrophysical Accretion as an Analogue Gravity Phenomena,"  In recent years, strong analogies have been established between the physics
of acoustic perturbations in an inhomogeneous dynamical fluid system, and some
kinematic features of space-time in general relativity. An effective metric,
referred to as the `acoustic metric', which describes the geometry of the
manifold in which acoustic perturbations propagate, can be constructed. This
effective geometry can capture the properties of curved space-time in general
relativity. Physical models constructed utilizing such analogies are called
`analogue gravity models'. Classical analogue gravity effect may be observed
when acoustic perturbations propagate through a inhomogeneous transonic
classical fluid. The acoustic horizon, which resembles a black hole event
horizon in many ways, is generated at the transonic point in the fluid flow.
The acoustic horizon is essentially a null hyper surface, generators of which
are the acoustic null geodesics, i.e. the phonons. The acoustic horizon emits
acoustic radiation with quasi thermal phonon spectra, which is analogous to the
actual Hawking radiation. The temperature of the radiation emitted from the
acoustic horizon is referred to as the analogue Hawking temperature.
  It has been demonstrated that, in general, the transonic accretion in
astrophysics can be considered as an example of the classical analogue gravity
model naturally found in the Universe.

"Predicting the connectivity of primate cortical networks from
  topological and spatial node properties","  The organization of the connectivity between mammalian cortical areas has
become a major subject of study, because of its important role in scaffolding
the macroscopic aspects of animal behavior and intelligence. In this study we
present a computational reconstruction approach to the problem of network
organization, by considering the topological and spatial features of each area
in the primate cerebral cortex as subsidy for the reconstruction of the global
cortical network connectivity. Starting with all areas being disconnected,
pairs of areas with similar sets of features are linked together, in an attempt
to recover the original network structure. Inferring primate cortical
connectivity from the properties of the nodes, remarkably good reconstructions
of the global network organization could be obtained, with the topological
features allowing slightly superior accuracy to the spatial ones. Analogous
reconstruction attempts for the C. elegans neuronal network resulted in
substantially poorer recovery, indicating that cortical area interconnections
are relatively stronger related to the considered topological and spatial
properties than neuronal projections in the nematode. The close relationship
between area-based features and global connectivity may hint on developmental
rules and constraints for cortical networks. Particularly, differences between
the predictions from topological and spatial properties, together with the
poorer recovery resulting from spatial properties, indicate that the
organization of cortical networks is not entirely determined by spatial
constraints.

The study found that there is a strong relationship between the spatial location of cortical nodes and their connectivity patterns, with nodes that are closer together tending to have more connections. Additionally, the study found that certain topological features of the network, such as clustering coefficient and betweenness centrality, were also predictive of connectivity patterns. Overall, the study suggests that both spatial and topological properties are important in understanding the organization of primate cortical networks and may have implications for understanding brain function and dysfunction.",2007-05-23,True
"The Intrinsic Origin of Spin Echoes in Dipolar Solids Generated by
  Strong Pi Pulses","  In spectroscopy, it is conventional to treat pulses much stronger than the
linewidth as delta-functions. In NMR, this assumption leads to the prediction
that pi pulses do not refocus the dipolar coupling. However, NMR spin echo
measurements in dipolar solids defy these conventional expectations when more
than one pi pulse is used. Observed effects include a long tail in the CPMG
echo train for short delays between pi pulses, an even-odd asymmetry in the
echo amplitudes for long delays, an unusual fingerprint pattern for
intermediate delays, and a strong sensitivity to pi-pulse phase. Experiments
that set limits on possible extrinsic causes for the phenomena are reported. We
find that the action of the system's internal Hamiltonian during any real pulse
is sufficient to cause the effects. Exact numerical calculations, combined with
average Hamiltonian theory, identify novel terms that are sensitive to
parameters such as pulse phase, dipolar coupling, and system size.
Visualization of the entire density matrix shows a unique flow of quantum
coherence from non-observable to observable channels when applying repeated pi
pulses.

"The Intrinsic Origin of Spin Echoes in Dipolar Solids Generated by
  Strong Pi Pulses","This research paper aims to investigate the intrinsic origin of spin echoes in dipolar solids generated by strong pi pulses. The study focuses on the behavior of spin echoes in dipolar systems, which are known to exhibit complex dynamics due to the long-range interactions between spins. The research uses a combination of theoretical analysis and experimental measurements to explore the relationship between the strength of the pi pulse and the resulting spin echo signal. The results show that the intrinsic properties of the dipolar solid, such as the spin-spin coupling strength and the distribution of dipolar couplings, play a crucial role in the generation of spin echoes. Understanding the intrinsic origin of spin echoes in dipolar solids has important implications for the development of new techniques in solid-state NMR spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging.",2009-11-13,True
"Exploring the Partonic Structure of Hadrons through the Drell-Yan

of hadrons. Since the process proceeds through a quark-antiquark annihilation,
Drell-Yan scattering possesses a unique ability to selectively probe sea
distributions. This review examines the application of Drell-Yan scattering to
elucidating the flavor asymmetry of the nucleon's sea and nuclear modifications
to the sea quark distributions in unpolarized scattering. Polarized beams and

Disordering Transitions and Peak Effect in Polydisperse Particle Systems,"  We show numerically that in a binary system of Yukawa particles, a dispersity
driven disordering transition occurs. In the presence of quenched disorder this
disordering transition coincides with a marked increase in the depinning
threshold, known as a peak effect. We find that the addition of poorly pinned
particles can increase the overall pinning in the sample by increasing the
amount of topological disorder present. If the quenched disorder is strong
enough to create a significant amount of topological disorder in the
monodisperse system, addition of a poorly pinned species generates further
disorder but does not produce a peak in the depinning force. Our results
indicate that for binary mixtures, optimal pinning occurs for topological
defect fraction densities of 0.2 to 0.25. For defect densities below this
range, the system retains orientational order. We determine the effect of the
pinning density, strength, and radius on the depinning peak and find that the
peak effect is more pronounced in weakly pinning systems.

Disordering Transitions and Peak Effect in Polydisperse Particle Systems,"The research paper investigates the phenomenon of peak effect in polydisperse particle systems, which refers to the peak in the critical current density as a function of magnetic field. The authors study the disordering transitions that occur in such systems, which can lead to the formation of vortices and affect the peak effect. Using simulations and experiments, the authors explore the effects of particle size distribution, interparticle interactions, and other factors on the disordering transitions and peak effect. They find that the peak effect is determined by a delicate balance between disordering and ordering effects, and that polydispersity can enhance or suppress the peak effect depending on the specific system. The results of the study have implications for the design and optimization of superconducting materials and other particle systems with disordering transitions.",2009-11-13,True
Casimir effect in a 6D warped flux compactification model,"  We discuss Casimir effect of a massless, minimally coupled scalar field in a
6D warped flux compactification model and its implications for the hierarchy
and cosmological constant problems, which are longstanding puzzles in
phenomenology and cosmology. Due to the scale invariance of the background
theory, the 4D effective theory contains a volume modulus. To stabilize the
modulus, we consider one-loop corrections to the effective potential by the
Casimir effect. The one-loop effective potential for the volume modulus has a
form which is very similar to Coleman-Weinberg potential. We evaluate
coefficients appearing in the effective potential by employing zeta function
regularization and heat kernel analysis. The volume modulus is stabilized for
smaller degrees of warping, below a critical value, which depends on deficit
angle of the reference brane. After stabilizing the modulus, it is possible to
obtain observed values of the mass ratio between the fundamental energy scales
and a tiny effective cosmological constant (though its sign is negative). The
degree of warping should be tuned to be close to the critical value, not as
severely as the original fine-tuning.

"Adiabatic Rotation, Quantum Search and Preparation of Superposition
  States","  We introduce the idea of using adiabatic rotation to generate superpositions
of a large class of quantum states. For quantum computing this is an
interesting alternative to the well-studied ""straight line"" adiabatic
evolution. In ways that complement recent results, we show how to efficiently
prepare three types of states: Kitaev's toric code state, the cluster state of
the measurement-based computation model and the history state used in the
adiabatic simulation of quantum circuit. We also show that the method, when
adapted for quantum search, provides quadratic speedup as other optimal methods
do with the advantages that the problem Hamiltonian is time-independent and
that the energy gap above the ground state is strictly nondecreasing with time.
Likewise the method can be used for optimization as an alternative to the usual
adiabatic algorithm.

"Gravitational collapse of spherically symmetric plasmas in
  Einstein-Maxwell spacetimes","  We utilize a recent formulation of a spherically symmetric spacetime endowed
with a general decomposition of the energy momentum tensor [Phys. Rev. D, 75,
024031 (2007)] to derive equations governing spherically symmetric
distributions of electromagnetic matter. We show the system reduces to the
Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime in general, spherically symmetric coordinates in
the vacuum limit. Furthermore, we show reduction to the charged Vaidya
spacetime in non-null coordinates when certain equations of states are chosen.
A model of gravitational collapse is discussed whereby a charged fluid resides
within a boundary of finite radial extent on the initial hypersurface, and is
allowed to radiate charged particles. Our formalism allows for the discussion
of all regions in this model without the need for complicated matching schemes
at the interfaces between successive regions. As further examples we consider
the collapse of a thin shell of charged matter onto a Reissner-Nordstrom black
hole. Finally, we reduce the entire system of equations to the static case such
that we have the equations for hydrostatic equilibrium of a charged fluid.
