Rough Sets Computations to Impute Missing Data,"  Many techniques for handling missing data have been proposed in the
literature. Most of these techniques are overly complex. This paper explores an
imputation technique based on rough set computations. In this paper,
characteristic relations are introduced to describe incompletely specified
decision tables.It is shown that the basic rough set idea of lower and upper
approximations for incompletely specified decision tables may be defined in a
variety of different ways. Empirical results obtained using real data are given
and they provide a valuable and promising insight to the problem of missing
data. Missing data were predicted with an accuracy of up to 99%.

"Asymptotics of Tracy-Widom distributions and the total integral of a
  Painlev\'e II function","  The Tracy-Widom distribution functions involve integrals of a Painlev\'e II
function starting from positive infinity. In this paper, we express the
Tracy-Widom distribution functions in terms of integrals starting from minus
infinity. There are two consequences of these new representations. The first is
the evaluation of the total integral of the Hastings-McLeod solution of the
Painlev\'e II equation. The second is the evaluation of the constant term of
the asymptotic expansions of the Tracy-Widom distribution functions as the
distribution parameter approaches minus infinity. For the GUE Tracy-Widom
distribution function, this gives an alternative proof of the recent work of

The discrepancy in G-band contrast: Where is the quiet Sun?,"  We compare the rms contrast in observed speckle reconstructed G-band images
with synthetic filtergrams computed from two magneto-hydrodynamic simulation
snapshots. The observations consist of 103 bursts of 80 frames each taken at
the Dunn Solar Telescope (DST), sampled at twice the diffraction limit of the
telescope. The speckle reconstructions account for the performance of the
Adaptive Optics (AO) system at the DST to supply reliable photometry. We find a
considerable discrepancy in the observed rms contrast of 14.1% for the best
reconstructed images, and the synthetic rms contrast of 21.5% in a simulation
snapshot thought to be representative of the quiet Sun. The areas of features
in the synthetic filtergrams that have positive or negative contrast beyond the
minimum and maximum values in the reconstructed images have spatial scales that
should be resolved. This leads us to conclude that there are fundamental
differences in the rms G-band contrast between observed and computed
filtergrams. On the basis of the substantially reduced granular contrast of
16.3% in the synthetic plage filtergram we speculate that the quiet-Sun may
contain more weak magnetic field than previously thought.

The discrepancy in G-band contrast: Where is the quiet Sun?,"The quiet Sun has been a topic of interest for solar physicists for decades.

Using high-resolution images from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we analyze G-band contrast in different regions of the quiet Sun. Our results suggest that the discrepancy in G-band contrast is related to the presence of small-scale magnetic fields and their interaction with convective motions. We also discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of the quiet Sun's magnetic field and its role in the Sun's activity cycle.",2009-11-13,True
Fundamental Limits to Position Determination by Concentration Gradients,"  Position determination in biological systems is often achieved through
protein concentration gradients. Measuring the local concentration of such a
protein with a spatially-varying distribution allows the measurement of
position within the system. In order for these systems to work effectively,
position determination must be robust to noise. Here, we calculate fundamental
limits to the precision of position determination by concentration gradients
due to unavoidable biochemical noise perturbing the gradients. We focus on
gradient proteins with first order reaction kinetics. Systems of this type have
been experimentally characterised in both developmental and cell biology
settings. For a single gradient we show that, through time-averaging, great
precision can potentially be achieved even with very low protein copy numbers.
As a second example, we investigate the ability of a system with oppositely
directed gradients to find its centre. With this mechanism, positional
precision close to the centre improves more slowly with increasing averaging
time, and so longer averaging times or higher copy numbers are required for
high precision. For both single and double gradients, we demonstrate the
existence of optimal length scales for the gradients, where precision is
maximized, as well as analyzing how precision depends on the size of the
concentration measuring apparatus. Our results provide fundamental constraints
on the positional precision supplied by concentration gradients in various
contexts, including both in developmental biology and also within a single
cell.

This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of these limitations, taking into account the properties of the gradient, the sensing mechanism, and the surrounding environment. The results show that the achievable accuracy is highly dependent on the specific application and the design parameters. The insights gained from this analysis can guide the development of more efficient and reliable concentration gradient-based position determination systems.",2007-05-23,True
"Linked by Loops: Network Structure and Switch Integration in Complex
  Dynamical Systems","  Simple nonlinear dynamical systems with multiple stable stationary states are
often taken as models for switchlike biological systems. This paper considers
the interaction of multiple such simple multistable systems when they are
embedded together into a larger dynamical ""supersystem."" Attention is focused
on the network structure of the resulting set of coupled differential
equations, and the consequences of this structure on the propensity of the
embedded switches to act independently versus cooperatively. Specifically, it
is argued that both larger average and larger variance of the node degree
distribution lead to increased switch independence. Given the frequency of
empirical observations of high variance degree distributions (e.g., power-law)
in biological networks, it is suggested that the results presented here may aid
in identifying switch-integrating subnetworks as comparatively homogenous,
low-degree, substructures. Potential applications to ecological problems such

"Kondo Physics in Nanotubes: Magnetic-field dependence and

this linear dependence, in qualitative agreement with theoretical expectations.
For even electron occupancy, we observe a spin-1 Kondo effect due to the

"Sabbath Day Home Automation: ""It's Like Mixing Technology and Religion""","The research paper titled ""Sabbath Day Home Automation: It's Like Mixing Technology and Religion"" explores the intersection of technology and religion, specifically in the context of Sabbath observance. The central theme is how home automation can be used to enhance the observance of the Sabbath, which is a day of rest and religious observance in the Jewish faith. 

The paper discusses the challenges faced by Orthodox Jews who observe Sabbath laws, which prohibit the use of electricity and certain types of labor. It then explores how home automation technologies can be used to overcome these challenges by automating household tasks and limiting the use of electricity, allowing individuals to focus on prayer and relaxation.

Capacity Gain from Two-Transmitter and Two-Receiver Cooperation,"  Capacity improvement from transmitter and receiver cooperation is
investigated in a two-transmitter, two-receiver network with phase fading and
full channel state information available at all terminals. The transmitters
cooperate by first exchanging messages over an orthogonal transmitter
cooperation channel, then encoding jointly with dirty paper coding. The
receivers cooperate by using Wyner-Ziv compress-and-forward over an analogous
orthogonal receiver cooperation channel. To account for the cost of
cooperation, the allocation of network power and bandwidth among the data and
cooperation channels is studied. It is shown that transmitter cooperation
outperforms receiver cooperation and improves capacity over non-cooperative
transmission under most operating conditions when the cooperation channel is
strong. However, a weak cooperation channel limits the transmitter cooperation
rate; in this case receiver cooperation is more advantageous.
Transmitter-and-receiver cooperation offers sizable additional capacity gain
over transmitter-only cooperation at low SNR, whereas at high SNR transmitter
cooperation alone captures most of the cooperative capacity improvement.

Evaluating Personal Archiving Strategies for Internet-based Information,"  Internet-based personal digital belongings present different vulnerabilities

Quantile and Probability Curves Without Crossing,"  This paper proposes a method to address the longstanding problem of lack of
monotonicity in estimation of conditional and structural quantile functions,
also known as the quantile crossing problem. The method consists in sorting or
monotone rearranging the original estimated non-monotone curve into a monotone
rearranged curve. We show that the rearranged curve is closer to the true
quantile curve in finite samples than the original curve, establish a
functional delta method for rearrangement-related operators, and derive
functional limit theory for the entire rearranged curve and its functionals. We
also establish validity of the bootstrap for estimating the limit law of the
the entire rearranged curve and its functionals. Our limit results are generic
in that they apply to every estimator of a monotone econometric function,
provided that the estimator satisfies a functional central limit theorem and
the function satisfies some smoothness conditions. Consequently, our results
apply to estimation of other econometric functions with monotonicity

Dbar-N interaction from meson-exchange and quark-gluon dynamics,"  We investigate the Dbar-N interaction at low energies using a meson-exchange
model supplemented with a short-distance contribution from one-gluon-exchange.
The model is developed in close analogy to the meson-exchange KN interaction of
the Juelich group utilizing SU(4) symmetry constraints. The main ingredients of
the interaction are provided by vector meson (rho, omega) exchange and
higher-order box diagrams involving D*N, D\Delta, and D*\Delta intermediate
states. The short range part is assumed to receive additional contributions
from genuine quark-gluon processes. The predicted cross sections for Dbar-N for
excess energies up to 150 MeV are of the same order of magnitude as those for
KN but with average values of around 20 mb, roughly a factor two larger than
for the latter system. It is found that the omega-exchange plays a very
important role. Its interference pattern with the rho-exchange, which is
basically fixed by the assumed SU(4) symmetry, clearly determines the
qualitative features of the Dbar-N interaction -- very similiar to what happens
also for the KN system.

Dbar-N interaction from meson-exchange and quark-gluon dynamics,"The research paper titled ""Dbar-N interaction from meson-exchange and quark-gluon dynamics"" aims to investigate the interaction between the antideuteron (Dbar) and the nucleon (N) using two different theoretical approaches: meson-exchange and quark-gluon dynamics. The main objective is to understand the nature of the Dbar-N interaction and how it is influenced by the underlying quark-gluon dynamics.

The researchers used a combination of effective field theory and lattice QCD simulations to study the Dbar-N interaction. They found that the interaction is primarily driven by the exchange of mesons, such as pions and rho mesons, which mediate the strong force between the Dbar and N. However, they also found that the quark-gluon dynamics play an important role in shaping the interaction, particularly at short distances.

The study also revealed that the Dbar-N interaction is sensitive to the properties of the Dbar, such as its size and binding energy, which in turn depend on the properties of the underlying quark-gluon dynamics. This has important implications for the production and detection of antideuterons in high-energy experiments.

Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into the nature of the Dbar-N interaction and highlights the importance of considering both meson-exchange and quark-gluon dynamics in theoretical models of nuclear interactions.",2008-11-26,True

First proper motions of thin dust filaments at the Galactic Center,"  Context: L'-band (3.8 micron) images of the Galactic Center show a large
number of thin filaments in the mini-spiral, located west of the mini-cavity
and along the inner edge of the Northern Arm. One possible mechanism that could
produce such structures is the interaction of a central wind with the
mini-spiral. Additionally, we identify similar features that appear to be
associated with stars. Aims: We present the first proper motion measurements of
the thin dust filaments observed in the central parsec around SgrA* and
investigate possible mechanisms that could be responsible for the observed
motions. Methods: The observations have been carried out using the NACO
adaptive optics system at the ESO VLT. The images have been transformed to a
common coordinate system and features of interest were extracted. Then a
cross-correlation technique could be performed in order to determine the
offsets between the features with respect to their position in the reference
epoch. Results: We derive the proper motions of a number of filaments and 2
cometary shaped dusty sources close (in projection) to SgrA*. We show that the
shape and the motion of the filaments does not agree with a purely Keplerian
motion of the gas in the potential of the supermassive black hole at the
position of SgrA*. Therefore, additional mechanisms must be responsible for
their formation and motion. We argue that the properties of the filaments are
probably related to an outflow from the disk of young mass-losing stars around

HD97048: a closer look to the disk,"  Aims: Today, large ground-based instruments, like VISIR on the VLT, providing
diffraction-limited (about 0.3 arcsec) images in the mid-infrared where strong
PAH features appear enable us to see the flaring structure of the disks around
Herbig Ae stars.
  Although great progress has been made in modelling the disk with radiative
transfer models able to reproduce the spectral energy distribution (SED) of
Herbig Ae stars, the constraints brought by images have not been yet fully
exploited. Here, we are interested in checking if these new observational
imaging constraints can be accounted for by predictions based on existing
models of passive centrally irradiated hydrostatic disks made to fit the SEDs

  Methods: The images taken by VISIR in the 8.6 and 11.3 microns aromatic
features reveal a large flaring disk around HD97048 inclined to the line of
sight. In order to analyse the spatial distribution of these data, we use a
disk model which includes the most up to date understanding of disk structure

addition to transiently-heated PAHs.
  Results: We compare the observed spatial distribution of the PAH emission
feature and the adjacent continuum emission with predictions based on existing
full disk models. Both SED and spatial distribution are in very good agreement
with the model predictions for common disk parameters.

Inclusion of a friction term proportional to the relative transverse velocity

of a stratified external medium, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and the
friction-driven instability can set in for flow speeds significantly lower than
the Alfv{\'e}n speed. Dissipative effects can excite flow-driven instability

level, the main claim of this paper is that syntactic networks should be
interpreted as the outcome of the use of the syntactic machinery. Thus, the
intrinsic features of such machinery are not accessible directly from (known)
network properties. Rather, what one can see are the global patterns of its use
and, thus, a global view of the power and organization of the underlying
grammar. Taking a look into more practical issues, the paper examines how to
build a net from the projection of syntactic relations. Recall that, as opposed
to adult grammars, early-child language has not a well-defined concept of
structure. To overcome such difficulty, we develop a set of systematic criteria
assuming constituency hierarchy and a grammar based on lexico-thematic
relations. At the end, what we obtain is a well defined corpora annotation that
enables us i) to perform statistics on the size of structures and ii) to build
a network from syntactic relations over which we can perform the standard
measures of complexity. We also provide a detailed example.

"Shear-strain-induced Spatially Varying Super-lattice Structures on
  Graphite studied by STM","  We report on the Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) observation of linear
fringes together with spatially varying super-lattice structures on (0001)
graphite (HOPG) surface. The structure, present in a region of a layer bounded
by two straight carbon fibers, varies from a hexagonal lattice of 6nm
periodicity to nearly a square lattice of 13nm periodicity. It then changes
into a one-dimensional (1-D) fringe-like pattern before relaxing into a
pattern-free region. We attribute this surface structure to a shear strain
giving rise to a spatially varying rotation of the affected graphite layer
relative to the bulk substrate. We propose a simple method to understand these
moire patterns by looking at the fixed and rotated lattices in the Fourier
transformed k-space. Using this approach we can reproduce the spatially varying

1st-row atoms and those placed at hydrogens, as well as the effect of different
contraction and valence splitting schemes. On the other hand, the investigation
of the heterolevel assumption, which is defined here to be that which states
that heterolevel MCs are more efficient than homolevel MCs. The heterolevel
approximation is very commonly used in the literature, but it is seldom
checked. As far as we know, the only tests for peptides or related systems,
have been performed using a small number of conformers, and this is the first

"A Model of Late Long-Term Potentiation Simulates Aspects of Memory
  Maintenance","  Late long-term potentiation (L-LTP) appears essential for the formation of
long-term memory, with memories at least partly encoded by patterns of
strengthened synapses. How memories are preserved for months or years, despite
molecular turnover, is not well understood. Ongoing recurrent neuronal
activity, during memory recall or during sleep, has been hypothesized to
preferentially potentiate strong synapses, preserving memories. This hypothesis
has not been evaluated in the context of a mathematical model representing
biochemical pathways important for L-LTP. I incorporated ongoing activity into
two such models: a reduced model that represents some of the essential
biochemical processes, and a more detailed published model. The reduced model
represents synaptic tagging and gene induction intuitively, and the detailed
model adds activation of essential kinases by Ca. Ongoing activity was modeled
as continual brief elevations of [Ca]. In each model, two stable states of
synaptic weight resulted. Positive feedback between synaptic weight and the
amplitude of ongoing Ca transients underlies this bistability. A tetanic or
theta-burst stimulus switches a model synapse from a low weight to a high
weight stabilized by ongoing activity. Bistability was robust to parameter
variations. Simulations illustrated that prolonged decreased activity reset
synapses to low weights, suggesting a plausible forgetting mechanism. However,
episodic activity with shorter inactive intervals maintained strong synapses.
Both models support experimental predictions. Tests of these predictions are
expected to further understanding of how neuronal activity is coupled to
maintenance of synaptic strength.

Absorption spectroscopy of individual single-walled carbon nanotubes,"  Current methods for producing single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) lead to

classification of the cylindrical ordered morphologies by expansion of the

consideration. In particular, occurrence of the helical morphologies is a
rather general consequence of the imposed cylindrical symmetry for narrow
enough capillaries. We discuss also the ODT and OOT involving some other

"Consistency between renormalization group running of chiral operator and
  counting rule -- Case of chiral pion production operator --","  In nuclear chiral perturbation theory (ChPT), an operator is defined in a

renormalization group (WRG) equation, and examine this consistency. As an
example, we study the s-wave pion production operator for NN\to d pi, derived

chiral-symmetry-violating (CSV) interaction, provided that we start with an
operator which does not contain a CSV term. We analytically show how the

Identifying network communities with a high resolution,"  Community structure is an important property of complex networks. An
automatic discovery of such structure is a fundamental task in many
disciplines, including sociology, biology, engineering, and computer science.
Recently, several community discovery algorithms have been proposed based on
the optimization of a quantity called modularity (Q). However, the problem of
modularity optimization is NP-hard, and the existing approaches often suffer
from prohibitively long running time or poor quality. Furthermore, it has been

In this research, we first propose an efficient heuristic algorithm, Qcut,

Using both synthetic and real networks, we show that Qcut can find higher
modularities and is more scalable than the existing algorithms. Furthermore,
using Qcut as an essential component, we propose a recursive algorithm, HQcut,

detect communities at a much finer scale and with a higher accuracy than the

An Alternative Source for Dark Energy,"Abstract:

The nature of dark energy remains one of the most enigmatic and challenging problems in modern cosmology. The standard model of cosmology postulates that dark energy is a mysterious force that drives the accelerated expansion of the universe. However, this model remains incomplete and unsatisfactory, as it relies on an unconfirmed and puzzling assumption about the nature of dark energy. In this paper, we propose an alternative source for dark energy that may resolve some of the existing problems with the standard model. Specifically, we suggest that dark energy may arise from the quantum vacuum fluctuations of a new scalar field that interacts with matter and radiation. We show that this hypothesis is consistent with current observational data and may provide a more natural explanation for the observed acceleration of the universe. Our results suggest that further investigation into the properties and dynamics of this new scalar field could shed light on the fundamental nature of dark energy and the origin of cosmic acceleration.",2016-11-15,True

particles, and the asymmetric pores lead to an asymmetry in the diffusion rates
of these particles. The presence of even a small percentage of large particles
can clog a membrane, preventing passage of the small particles in one direction

The widths of quarkonia in quark gluon plasma,"  Recent lattice calculations showed that the quarkonia will survive beyond the

"Matrix Exponential-Based Closures for the Turbulent Subgrid-Scale Stress
  Tensor","  Two approaches for closing the turbulence subgrid-scale stress tensor in
terms of matrix exponentials are introduced and compared. The first approach is
based on a formal solution of the stress transport equation in which the
production terms can be integrated exactly in terms of matrix exponentials.
This formal solution of the subgrid-scale stress transport equation is shown to
be useful to explore special cases, such as the response to constant velocity
gradient, but neglecting pressure-strain correlations and diffusion effects.
The second approach is based on an Eulerian-Lagrangian change of variables,
combined with the assumption of isotropy for the conditionally averaged
Lagrangian velocity gradient tensor and with the `Recent Fluid Deformation'
(RFD) approximation. It is shown that both approaches lead to the same basic
closure in which the stress tensor is expressed as the product of the matrix
exponential of the resolved velocity gradient tensor multiplied by its
transpose. Short-time expansions of the matrix exponentials are shown to
provide an eddy-viscosity term and particular quadratic terms, and thus allow a
reinterpretation of traditional eddy-viscosity and nonlinear stress closures.
The basic feasibility of the matrix-exponential closure is illustrated by
implementing it successfully in Large Eddy Simulation of forced isotropic
turbulence. The matrix-exponential closure employs the drastic approximation of
entirely omitting the pressure-strain correlation and other `nonlinear
scrambling' terms. But unlike eddy-viscosity closures, the matrix exponential

"Gaussian-Basis Monte Carlo Method for Numerical Study on Ground States
  of Itinerant and Strongly Correlated Electron Systems","  We examine Gaussian-basis Monte Carlo method (GBMC) introduced by Corney and
Drummond. This method is based on an expansion of the density-matrix operator
rho by means of the coherent Gaussian-type operator basis Lambda and does not
suffer from the minus sign problem. The original method, however, often fails
in reproducing the true ground state and causes systematic errors of calculated
physical quantities because the samples are often trapped in some metastable or
symmetry broken states. To overcome this difficulty, we combine the
quantum-number projection scheme proposed by Assaad, Werner, Corboz, Gull and
Troyer in conjunction with the importance sampling of the original GBMC method.
This improvement allows us to carry out the importance sampling in the
quantum-number-projected phase-space. Some comparisons with the previous
quantum-number projection scheme indicate that, in our method, the convergence
with the ground state is accelerated, which makes it possible to extend the
applicability and widen the range of tractable parameters in the GBMC method.
The present scheme offers an efficient practical way of computation for
strongly correlated electron systems beyond the range of system sizes,

The origin of the work function,"  In this paper we analyse the mechanisms responsible for the bonding of
electrons to metal surfaces. We present and validate a method to measure the
energy distribution of dense electron ensembles at ambient conditions. We have
found sharp structures in the energy distribution of charge confined at metal
surfaces. These structures correspond to the onset of space charge i.e.
electron emission. The threshold energy for emission increases linear with the
free electron density. We conclude that the work function is a direct measure
of the Hartree-Fock exchange energy. Remarkably, the emissions that have been
observed do not obey the Einstein-Millikan threshold relation for the photo
electric effect. By discrimination between requirements for energy and momentum
we deduce that electron emissions are trigged by photon momentum. We claim that
the photo electric effect is the result of a phase transition in an electron
gas that connects a surface bound, condensed state to a free continuum state.
The assignment of a phase transition to the effect under consideration is
justified by analyzing the behaviour of the Fermi-Dirac energy distribution
upon raising the Fermi level. We predict an abrupt increment in the number of
electrons in the continuum that exceeds 70 orders of magnitude. Both the
observed threshold energy and the line shape of the transition are in good

Are the most metal-poor galaxies young?,"  We review the possibility that metallicity could provide a diagnostic for the
age of a galaxy, hence that the most metal-poor star forming galaxies in the

downsizing shows the average age of the stars in a galaxy to decrease with
decreasing mass and metallicity. However, we conclude both from observational

Consequently the most metal poor galaxies of our local universe are not

Trapping mechanism in overdamped ratchets with quenched noise,"  A trapping mechanism is observed and proposed as the origin of the anomalous

Fluidization of a vertically oscillated shallow granular layer,"  Molecular dynamics simulations are used to study fluidization of a vertically
vibrated, three-dimensional shallow granular layer. As the container
acceleration is increased above g, the granular temperature and root mean
square particle displacement increase, gradually fluidizing the layer. For
nearly elastic particles, or low shaking frequencies, or small layer depths,
the end of the fluidization process is marked by an abrupt increase in the
granular temperature and rms particle displacement. The layer is then fully
fluidized since macroscopic, fluid-like phenomena such as convection rolls and
surface waves are observed. Increasing the total dissipation (by either
decreasing the restitution coefficient or increasing the total number of
particles) decreases the increase in granular temperature and rms particle
displacement at fluidization, and shifts the increase to higher accelerations.
Increasing the frequency also decreases the magnitude of the jump, and shifts
the change to lower accelerations.

Direct imaging of lateral movements of AMPA receptors inside synapses,"  Trafficking of AMPA receptors in and out of synapses is crucial for synaptic

"Multisite campaign on the open cluster M67. III. Delta Scuti pulsations

open cluster M67. The data set consists of photometric time series from eight

two stars, EW Cnc and EX Cnc, we detect the highest number of frequencies (41

Cnc has the second highest number of frequencies detected in any delta Scuti
star. We have computed a grid of pulsation models that take the effects of

Current Noise in Quantum Point Contacts,"  We present measurements of current noise in quantum point contacts as a

The infrared environments of masers associated with star formation,"  The near infrared (1-2um) and the thermal infrared (3-25um) trace many of the
environments in which masers are thought to reside, including shocks, outflows,
accretion disks, and the dense medium near protostars. After a number of recent
surveys it has been found that there is a higher detection rate of mid-IR
emission towards masers than cm radio continuum emission from UC HII regions,
and that the mid-IR emission is actually more closely cospatial to the maser
locations. A high percentage of water and methanol masers that are not
coincident with the UC HII regions in massive star forming regions are likely
to be tracing outflows and extremely young high mass stars before the onset of
the UC HII region phase. After a decade of groundwork supporting the hypothesis
that linarly distributed class II methanol masers may generally trace accretion
disks around young massive stars, compelling evidence is mounting that these
masers may generally be associated with outflows instead. Substantiation of

An abundance of invariant polynomials satisfying the Riemann hypothesis,"  In 1999, Iwan Duursma defined the zeta function for a linear code as a

Ensemble Learning for Free with Evolutionary Algorithms ?,"  Evolutionary Learning proceeds by evolving a population of classifiers, from

Cascading on extragalactic background light,"  High-energy gamma-rays propagating in the intergalactic medium can interact
with background infrared photons to produce e+e- pairs, resulting in the
absorption of the intrinsic gamma-ray spectrum. TeV observations of the distant
blazar 1ES 1101-232 were thus recently used to put an upper limit on the
infrared extragalactic background light density. The created pairs can
upscatter background photons to high energies, which in turn may pair produce,
thereby initiating a cascade. The pairs diffuse on the extragalactic magnetic
field (EMF) and cascade emission has been suggested as a means for measuring
its intensity. Limits on the IR background and EMF are reconsidered taking into
account cascade emissions. The cascade equations are solved numerically.
Assuming a power-law intrinsic spectrum, the observed 100 MeV - 100 TeV
spectrum is found as a function of the intrinsic spectral index and the
intensity of the EMF. Cascades emit mainly at or below 100 GeV. The observed
TeV spectrum appears softer than for pure absorption when cascade emission is
taken into account. The upper limit on the IR photon background is found to be
robust. Inversely, the intrinsic spectra needed to fit the TeV data are
uncomfortably hard when cascade emission makes a significant contribution to
the observed spectrum. An EMF intensity around 1e-8 nG leads to a
characteristic spectral hump in the GLAST band. Higher EMF intensities divert
the pairs away from the line-of-sight and the cascade contribution to the
spectrum becomes negligible.

NBODY meets stellar population - The HYDE-PARC Project,"  N-body simulations give us a rough idea of how the shape of a simulated
object appears in three-dimensional space. From an observational point of view
this may give us a misleading picture. The faint stars may be the most common
stars in the system but the morphological information obtained by observations
of an object may be dominated by the color properties of the bright stars. Due
to dynamical effects, such as energy equipartition, different masses of stars
may populate different regions in the object. Since stars are evolving in mass
the stellar evolution may also influence the dynamics of the system. Hence, if
one is interested in simulating what the morphology will look like through a
telescope, one needs to simulate in addition evolving stars and weight them by
their luminosity. Therefore we need to combine simulations of the dynamical
evolution and a stellar population synthesis at the same time. For the
dynamical evolution part we use a parallel version of a direct N-body code,
NBODY6++. This code also includes stellar evolution. We link the parameters
from this stellar evolution routine to the BaSeL 2.0 stellar library. For
isolated clusters we found results assimilable to standard stellar population
synthesis codes such as the PEGASE code. For clusters in a tidal field we found
that the integrated colors become relatively bluer due to energy equipartition
effects. In the time shortly before dissolution of the cluster the stellar M/L
ratio becomes lower compared to isolated clusters. We compared the results of
our simulations to integrated spectra of galactic globular clusters. For the

that for flows with arbitrary shearing rate there exists a finite time interval

manifests itself in a twofold way, viz. by the over-reflection of the GAWs and
by the generation of GAWs from EM perturbations. It is shown that these
phenomena act as efficient transformers of the equilibrium flow energy into the
energy of the perturbations for moderate and high shearing rate solar plasma
flows. Efficient generation of GAW by EM takes place for shearing rates about

determination of the absolute neutrino mass scale down to 0.2 eV, with
essentially smaller model dependence than from cosmology and neutrinoless
double beta decay. For this purpose, the integral electron energy spectrum is
measured close to the endpoint of molecular tritium beta decay. The endpoint,
together with the neutrino mass, should be fitted from the KATRIN data as a
free parameter. The right-handed couplings change the electron energy spectrum
close to the endpoint, therefore they have some effect also to the precise
neutrino mass determination. The statistical calculations show that, using the
endpoint as a free parameter, the unaccounted right-handed couplings
constrained by many beta decay experiments can change the fitted neutrino mass
value, relative to the true neutrino mass, by not larger than about 5-10 %.
Using, incorrectly, the endpoint as a fixed input parameter, the above change
of the neutrino mass can be much larger, order of 100 %, and for some cases it

The Complexity of Model Checking Higher-Order Fixpoint Logic,"  Higher-Order Fixpoint Logic (HFL) is a hybrid of the simply typed
\lambda-calculus and the modal \lambda-calculus. This makes it a highly
expressive temporal logic that is capable of expressing various interesting
correctness properties of programs that are not expressible in the modal
\lambda-calculus.
  This paper provides complexity results for its model checking problem. In
particular we consider those fragments of HFL built by using only types of
bounded order k and arity m. We establish k-fold exponential time completeness
for model checking each such fragment. For the upper bound we use fixpoint
elimination to obtain reachability games that are singly-exponential in the
size of the formula and k-fold exponential in the size of the underlying
transition system. These games can be solved in deterministic linear time. As a
simple consequence, we obtain an exponential time upper bound on the expression
complexity of each such fragment.
  The lower bound is established by a reduction from the word problem for
alternating (k-1)-fold exponential space bounded Turing Machines. Since there
are fixed machines of that type whose word problems are already hard with
respect to k-fold exponential time, we obtain, as a corollary, k-fold
exponential time completeness for the data complexity of our fragments of HFL,
provided m exceeds 3. This also yields a hierarchy result in expressive power.

Dynamical friction force exerted on spherical bodies,"  We present a rigorous calculation of the dynamical friction force exerted on
a spherical massive perturber moving through an infinite homogenous system of
field stars. By calculating the shape and mass of the polarization cloud
induced by the perturber in the background system, which decelerates the motion
of the perturber, we recover Chandrasekhar's drag force law with a modified
Coulomb logarithm. As concrete examples we calculate the drag force exerted on
a Plummer sphere or a sphere with the density distribution of a Hernquist
profile. It is shown that the shape of the perturber affects only the exact
form of the Coulomb logarithm. The latter converges on small scales, because
encounters of the test and field stars with impact parameters less than the
size of the massive perturber become inefficient. We confirm this way earlier
results based on the impulse approximation of small angle scatterings.

understood on the basis of a pinning of Gd moments arising from a column-like
growth mechanism of the Gd layers. A study of the effective anisotropy suggests
that perpendicular magnetic anisotropy could occur in multilayers consisting of

"On constraining a transiting exoplanet's rotation rate with its transit
  spectrum","  We investigate the effect of planetary rotation on the transit spectrum of an
extrasolar giant planet. During ingress and egress, absorption features arising
from the planet's atmosphere are Doppler shifted by of order the planet's
rotational velocity (~1-2 km/s) relative to where they would be if the planet
were not rotating. We focus in particular on the case of HD209458b, which ought
to be at least as good a target as any other known transiting planet. For
HD209458b, this shift should give rise to a small net centroid shift of ~60
cm/s on the stellar absorption lines. Using a detailed model of the
transmission spectrum due to a rotating star transited by a rotating planet
with an isothermal atmosphere, we simulate the effect of the planet's rotation
on the shape of the spectral lines, and in particular on the magnitude of their
width and centroid shift. We then use this simulation to determine the expected
signal-to-noise ratio for distinguishing a rotating from a non-rotating planet,
and assess how this S/N scales with various parameters of HD209458b. We find

"Entanglement, fidelity and topological entropy in a quantum phase
  transition to topological order","  We present a numerical study of a quantum phase transition from a
spin-polarized to a topologically ordered phase in a system of spin-1/2
particles on a torus. We demonstrate that this non-symmetry-breaking
topological quantum phase transition (TOQPT) is of second order. The transition
is analyzed via the ground state energy and fidelity, block entanglement,
Wilson loops, and the recently proposed topological entropy. Only the
topological entropy distinguishes the TOQPT from a standard QPT, and
remarkably, does so already for small system sizes. Thus the topological
entropy serves as a proper order parameter. We demonstrate that our conclusions

"Horizon-Penetrating Transonic Accretion Disks around Rotating Black

flows around rotating black holes are presented by using the Kerr-Schild
coordinate where there is no coordinate singularity at the event horizon. We
use two types of the causal viscosity prescription, and the boundary conditions

adiabatic accretion disks, the standard accretion disks, the supercritical
accretion disks. These solutions are obtained for both non-rotating and

horizon or inside the horizon, and the angular velocities of the accretion flow

Fifteen Years of High-Resolution Radio Imaging of Supernova 1987A,"  Supernova 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud provides a spectacularly
detailed view of the aftermath of a core-collapse explosion. The supernova
ejecta initially coasted outward at more than 10% of the speed of light, but in
1990 were observed to decelerate rapidly as they began to encounter dense
circumstellar material expelled by the progenitor star. The resulting shock has
subsequently produced steadily brightening radio synchrotron emission, which is
resolved by the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) into an expanding
limb-brightened shell. Here we present 15 years of ATCA imaging of Supernova
1987A, at an effective angular resolution of 0.4 arcsec. We find that the radio
remnant has accelerated in its expansion over this period, from approx 3600
km/s in 1992 to approx 5200 km/s at the end of 2006. The published diameters of
the evolving X-ray shell have been ~15% smaller than the corresponding radio
values, but a simultaneous Fourier analysis of both radio and X-ray data
eliminates this discrepancy, and yields a current diameter for the shell in
both wave-bands of approx 1.7 arcsec. An asymmetric brightness distribution is
seen in radio images at all ATCA epochs: the eastern and western rims have
higher fluxes than the northern and southern regions, indicating that most of
the radio emission comes from the equatorial plane of the system, where the
progenitor star's circumstellar wind is thought to be densest. The eastern lobe

Exact Floquet states of a driven condensate and their stabilities,"  We investigate the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for a classically chaotic

spatiotemporal vortices of nontrivial phase structures and zero-density cores.
Due to the velocity singularities of vortex cores and the blowing-up of
perturbed solutions, the spatiotemporal vortices are unstable periodic states
embedded in chaos. The stability and instability of these Floquet states are

Overall, this research highlights the potential of the E_6/U(1)_N model in explaining both neutrino mass and dark matter, and provides insights into the properties of such particles.",2008-11-26,True
"Deterministic Factors of Stock Networks based on Cross-correlation in
  Financial Market","  The stock market has been known to form homogeneous stock groups with a
higher correlation among different stocks according to common economic factors
that influence individual stocks. We investigate the role of common economic
factors in the market in the formation of stock networks, using the arbitrage
pricing model reflecting essential properties of common economic factors. We
find that the degree of consistency between real and model stock networks
increases as additional common economic factors are incorporated into our
model. Furthermore, we find that individual stocks with a large number of links
to other stocks in a network are more highly correlated with common economic
factors than those with a small number of links. This suggests that common
economic factors in the stock market can be understood in terms of
deterministic factors.

"Deterministic Factors of Stock Networks based on Cross-correlation in
  Financial Market","The research paper analyzes the deterministic factors of stock networks based on cross-correlation in financial markets. The study uses daily stock price data from the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange to construct a network of stocks based on cross-correlation coefficients. The researchers identify key stocks or hubs that play a vital role in the network's structure and dynamics. The analysis shows that the stock network's topology is influenced by both the underlying industry structure and the market conditions, with the market volatility being a significant determinant. The study also finds that the stock network's centralization and clustering increase during market downturns, indicating a higher degree of interdependence between stocks. These findings have practical implications for portfolio diversification and risk management strategies.",2009-11-13,True
Neural networks with transient state dynamics,"  We investigate dynamical systems characterized by a time series of distinct
semi-stable activity patterns, as they are observed in cortical neural activity
patterns. We propose and discuss a general mechanism allowing for an adiabatic
continuation between attractor networks and a specific adjoined transient-state
network, which is strictly dissipative. Dynamical systems with transient states
retain functionality when their working point is autoregulated; avoiding
prolonged periods of stasis or drifting into a regime of rapid fluctuations. We
show, within a continuous-time neural network model, that a single local
updating rule for online learning allows simultaneously (i) for information
storage via unsupervised Hebbian-type learning, (ii) for adaptive regulation of
the working point and (iii) for the suppression of runaway synaptic growth.
Simulation results are presented; the spontaneous breaking of time-reversal
symmetry and link symmetry are discussed.

Neural networks with transient state dynamics,"The paper titled ""Neural networks with transient state dynamics"" focuses on the exploration of neural networks that can exhibit transient dynamics in their state evolution. The authors propose a new class of neural network models, called Transient Neural Networks (TNNs), which are designed to capture the temporal dynamics of input data by incorporating a time-varying state variable. The TNNs are shown to be capable of capturing complex temporal patterns in the input data, making them suitable for a wide range of applications such as speech recognition, natural language processing, and signal processing. The authors also present a theoretical analysis of the TNNs, showing that they can be analyzed using tools from dynamical systems theory. Overall, the paper presents an innovative approach to designing neural networks that can capture the temporal dynamics of input data and provides a promising avenue for future research in this area.",2010-02-11,True
Baryon Asymmetry in a Heavy Moduli Scenario,"  In some models of supersymmetry breaking, modulus fields are heavy enough to
decay before BBN. But the large entropy produced via moduli decay significantly
dilutes the preexisting baryon asymmetry of the universe. We study whether
Affleck-Dine mechanism can provide enough baryon asymmetry which survives the
dilution, and find several situations in which desirable amount of baryon
number remains after the dilution. The possibility of non-thermal dark matter
is also discussed. This provides the realistic cosmological scenario with heavy
moduli.

Baryon Asymmetry in a Heavy Moduli Scenario,"This research paper investigates the baryon asymmetry problem in a heavy moduli scenario. We analyze the effective potential of the Higgs field and its role in generating a non-zero baryon number. Using a combination of numerical simulations and analytical calculations, we demonstrate that a heavy moduli field can lead to an efficient generation of baryon number asymmetry. Our results suggest that this scenario can provide a viable solution to the baryon asymmetry problem in the early universe. Overall, this study sheds light on the role of heavy moduli fields in understanding the origin of matter in the universe.",2008-11-26,True
Exact beta function from the holographic loop equation of large-N QCD_4,"  We construct and study a previously defined quantum holographic effective
action whose critical equation implies the holographic loop equation of large-N
QCD_4 for planar self-avoiding loops in a certain regularization scheme. We
extract from the effective action the exact beta function in the given scheme.
For the Wilsonean coupling constant the beta function is exacly one loop and
the first coefficient agrees with its value in perturbation theory. For the
canonical coupling constant the exact beta function has a NSVZ form and the
first two coefficients agree with their value in perturbation theory.

Exact beta function from the holographic loop equation of large-N QCD_4,"This research paper presents a new method for calculating the beta function of large-N QCD_4 using the holographic loop equation. The authors derive an exact expression for the beta function, which describes how the coupling constant of the theory changes as a function of energy scale. The results suggest that the beta function has a non-trivial fixed point, which is important for understanding the behavior of the theory at high energies. The authors also discuss the implications of their findings for the holographic duality between gravity and QCD_4. Overall, the paper provides a significant contribution to our understanding of large-N QCD_4 and its holographic dual.",2009-04-22,True
