"Phase structure, collective modes, and the axial anomaly in dense QCD","  Using a general Ginzburg-Landau effective Lagrangian, we study the
topological structure and low-lying collective modes of dense QCD having both
chiral and diquark condensates, for two and three massless flavors. As we found
earlier, the QCD axial anomaly acts as an external field applied to the chiral
condensate in a color superconductor and, as a new critical point emerges,
leads to a crossover between the broken chiral symmetry and color
superconducting phases. At intermediate densities where both chiral and diquark
condensates are present, we derive a generalized Gell-Mann- Oakes-Renner
relation between the masses of pseudoscalar bosons and the magnitude of the
chiral and diquark-condensates. We show explicitly the continuity of the
ordinary pion at low densities to a generalized pion at high densities.

"Phase structure, collective modes, and the axial anomaly in dense QCD","The paper ""Phase structure, collective modes, and the axial anomaly in dense QCD"" focuses on studying the properties of dense quark matter in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of strong interactions. The authors use a combination of analytical and numerical techniques to explore the phase structure of dense QCD at finite temperature and density, as well as the collective modes of the system and the effects of the axial anomaly.

The axial anomaly is a phenomenon in QCD that arises due to the non-conservation of the axial current in the presence of strong gauge fields. The authors show that the axial anomaly has important consequences for the properties of dense QCD, including the excitation spectrum of the system and the behavior of the chiral condensate.

One of the main outcomes of the paper is the identification of a new phase of dense QCD, known as the chiral density wave phase. This phase is characterized by the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry and the formation of a spatially modulated chiral condensate. The authors also analyze the collective modes of the system in this phase, including the emergence of a new gapless mode known as the chiral magnetic wave.

Overall, the paper provides new insights into the properties of dense quark matter in QCD and highlights the important role played by the axial anomaly in shaping the behavior of the system.",2008-11-26,True
658 GHz Vibrationally-Excited Water Masers with the Submillimeter Array,"  Discovered in 1995 at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO), the
vibrationally-excited water maser line at 658 GHz (455 micron) is seen in
oxygen-rich giant and supergiant stars. Because this maser can be so strong (up
to thousands of Janskys), it was very helpful during the commissioning phase of
the highest frequency band (620-700 GHz) of the Submillimeter Array (SMA)
interferometer. From late 2002 to early 2006, brief attempts were made to
search for emission from additional sources beyond the original CSO survey.
These efforts have expanded the source count from 10 to 16. The maser emission
appears to be quite compact spatially, as expected from theoretical
considerations; thus these objects can potentially be used as atmospheric phase
calibrators. Many of these objects also exhibit maser emission in the
vibrationally-excited SiO maser at 215 GHz. Because both maser lines likely
originate from a similar physical region, these objects can be used to test
techniques of phase transfer calibration between millimeter and submillimeter
bands. The 658 GHz masers will be important beacons to assess the performance
of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) in this challenging high-frequency
band.

"Minimum Expected Distortion in Gaussian Layered Broadcast Coding with
  Successive Refinement","  A transmitter without channel state information (CSI) wishes to send a
delay-limited Gaussian source over a slowly fading channel. The source is coded
in superimposed layers, with each layer successively refining the description
in the previous one. The receiver decodes the layers that are supported by the
channel realization and reconstructs the source up to a distortion. In the
limit of a continuum of infinite layers, the optimal power distribution that
minimizes the expected distortion is given by the solution to a set of linear
differential equations in terms of the density of the fading distribution. In
the optimal power distribution, as SNR increases, the allocation over the
higher layers remains unchanged; rather the extra power is allocated towards
the lower layers. On the other hand, as the bandwidth ratio b (channel uses per
source symbol) tends to zero, the power distribution that minimizes expected
distortion converges to the power distribution that maximizes expected
capacity. While expected distortion can be improved by acquiring CSI at the
transmitter (CSIT) or by increasing diversity from the realization of
independent fading paths, at high SNR the performance benefit from diversity
exceeds that from CSIT, especially when b is large.

of the optimization problem is based on the postulated principle of equal
dissipation rate during inelastic deformation. This principle leads to the
enforcement of stress constraints in domains where inelastic deformation would
occur. During the transition from the continuous structure to the truss-like
one (strut-and-tie model) the dissipation rate is kept constant using the
projected gradient method. The equal dissipation rate in the resulting truss
and in the original continuous structure can be regarded as an equivalence
statement and suggests an alternative understanding of physical motivation

Plastic-damage model for concrete in principal directions,"  In the present paper a plastic-damage model for concrete is discussed. Based
on the fact that for isotropic materials the elastic trial stress and the
projected plastic stress states have the same eigenvec-tors, the loading
surface is formulated in the principal stress space rather than using the
invariants of stress tensor. The model assumes that the directions of
orthotropic damage coincide with principal directions of elastic predictor
stress state (motivated by coaxial rotated crack model). Due to this
assumption, the load-ing surface and the closest point projection algorithm can
still be formulated in the principal directions. The evolution of the inelastic
strain is determined using minimization principle. Damage and plastic parts of
the inelastic strain are separated using a scalar parameter, which is assumed
to be stress dependent. The paper also discusses an effective numerical
implementation. The performance of the model is demonstrated on one
illustrative example.

Scalar damage model for concrete without explicit evolution law,"  Based on the fact that for an isotropic material model the elastic predictor
and the projected stress tensors have the same eigenvectors, it is shown that
the scalar damage can be obtained directly from the projection algorithm. This
eliminates the difficulty of a proper definition of equivalent strain which
serves as a driving force for evolution of damage in concrete. Moreover, if
eigenvectors are known it is not more nec-essary to use invariants of the
stress tensor for the formulation of loading surface. In the present model the
loading surface is represented in the polynomial form. This has two advantages:
(i) it automatically fulfils C1 continuity and (ii) plane stress formulation is
achieved by simply setting the third stress to zero. The perform-ance of the
model is illustrated on example of a mixed-mode fracture of concrete. It is
shown that for the pre-sent example the model prediction strongly depends on
the choice of the stress degradation law.

The results show that the model is able to capture the behavior of concrete under both monotonic and cyclic loading conditions. Furthermore, the model is shown to be computationally efficient and can be easily implemented in finite element codes for the analysis of concrete structures. Overall, the proposed scalar damage model provides a promising approach for the modeling of concrete behavior without the need for an explicit evolution law.",2007-05-23,True
Wormholes as Black Hole Foils,"  We study to what extent wormholes can mimic the observational features of

no-hair properties, quasi-normal-mode ringing, and even the dissipative
properties of black hole horizons, such as a finite surface resistivity equal
to 377 Ohms. The only way to distinguish the two geometries on an
observationally reasonable time scale would be through the detection of
Hawking's radiation, which is, however, too weak to be of practical relevance

GRBs, as it may present a viable mechanism to prevent the loss of angular
momentum by stellar winds at low metallicity, whilst strong Galactic WR winds

"Constraining GRB progenitor models by probing Wolf-Rayet wind geometries

rotating Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. However, most Galactic WR stars are slow
rotators, as stellar winds are thought to remove angular momentum. This poses a
challenge to the collapsar model. Recent observations indicate that GRBs occur
predominately in low metallicity (Z) environments, which may resolve the
problem: lower Z leads to less mass loss, which may inhibit angular momentum
removal, allowing WR stars to remain rotating rapidly until collapse. We wish
to determine whether low Z WR stars rotate on average more rapidly than
Galactic WR stars, and perform a Very Large Telescope (VLT) linear
spectropolarimetry survey of WR stars in the low Z environment of the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and compare our results with the Galactic sample. We
find that only 2 out of 13 (i.e. 15%) of LMC WR stars show line polarization
effects, compared to a similarly low fraction of ~15-20% for Galactic WR stars.
The low incidence of line polarization effects in LMC WR stars suggests that
the threshold metallicity where significant differences in WR rotational
properties occur is below that of the LMC (Z ~ 0.5 Zsun), possibly constraining
GRB progenitor channels to this upper metallicity.

Determining factors behind the PageRank log-log plot,"  We study the relation between PageRank and other parameters of information
networks such as in-degree, out-degree, and the fraction of dangling nodes. We
model this relation through a stochastic equation inspired by the original
definition of PageRank. Further, we use the theory of regular variation to
prove that PageRank and in-degree follow power laws with the same exponent. The
difference between these two power laws is in a multiple coefficient, which
depends mainly on the fraction of dangling nodes, average in-degree, the power
law exponent, and damping factor. The out-degree distribution has a minor
effect, which we explicitly quantify. Our theoretical predictions show a good

The aqueous and crystalline forms of L-alanine zwitterion,"  The structural properties of L-alanine amino acid in aqueous solution and in
crystalline phase have been studied by means of density-functional
electronic-structure and molecular dynamics simulations. The solvated
zwitterionic structure of L-alanine (+NH3-C2H4-COO-) was systematically
compared to the structure of its zwitterionic crystalline analogue acquired
from both computer simulations and experiments. It turns out that the
structural properties of an alanine molecule in aqueous solution can differ
significantly from those in crystalline phase, these differences being mainly
attributed to hydrogen bonding interactions. In particular, we found that the
largest difference between the two alanine forms can be seen for the
orientation and bond lengths of the carboxylate (COO-) group: in aqueous
solution the C-O bond lengths appear to strongly correlate with the number of
water molecules which form hydrogen bonds with the COO- group. Furthermore, the
hydrogen bond lengths are shorter and the hydrogen bond angles are larger for
L-alanine in water as compared to crystal. Overall, our findings strongly
suggest that the generally accepted approach of extending the structural
information acquired from crystallographic data to a L-alanine molecule in
aqueous solution should be used with caution.

Chemical Properties of Star Forming Dwarf Galaxies,"  Recent studies of the near-infrared (NIR) properties of dwarf irregular
galaxies (dIs) and blue compact dwarfs (BCDs) have provided improved estimates

Virgo Cluster from a run at Gemini-North in 2003. Combining these new
abundances with published values, we study the correlations among the
metallicity, Ks luminosity, gas mass, baryonic mass, and gas fraction. Within
errors, the two types of dwarfs appear to share a common relation between the
oxygen abundance and the luminosity in Ks. The correlation between metallicity
and the gas fraction is the same for BCDs as for dIs, indicating that BCD
evolution has been similar to dIs. Since dIs appear to have evolved as isolated

Spin-String Interaction in QCD Strings,"  I consider the question of the interaction between a QCD string and the spin
of a quark or an antiquark on whose worldline the string terminates. The
problem is analysed from the point of view of a string representation for the
expectation value of a Wilson loop for a spin-half particle. A string
representation of the super Wilson loop is obtained starting from an effective
string representation of a Wilson Loop. The action obtained in this manner is
invariant under a worldline supersymmetry and has a boundary term which
contains the spin-string interaction. For rectangular loops the spin-string
interaction vanishes and there is no spin-spin term in the resulting heavy
quark potential. On the other hand if an allowance is made for the finite
intrinsic thickness of the flux-tube, by assuming that the spin-string
interaction takes place not just at the boundary of the string world-sheet but
extends to a distance of the order of the intrinsic thickness of the flux tube,
then we do obtain a spin-spin interaction which falls as the fifth power of the
distance. Such a term was previously suggested by Kogut and Parisi in the
context of a flux-tube model of confinement.

"Resonant relaxation near a massive black hole: the dependence on
  eccentricity","  The orbits of stars close to a massive black hole are nearly Keplerian
ellipses. Such orbits exert long term torques on each other, which lead to an
enhanced angular momentum relaxation known as resonant relaxation. Under
certain conditions, this process can modify the angular momentum distribution
and affect the interaction rates of the stars with the massive black hole more
efficiently than non-resonant relaxation. The torque on an orbit exerted by the
cluster depends on the eccentricity of the orbit. In this paper, we calculate
this dependence and determine the resonant relaxation timescale as a function
of eccentricity. In particular, we show that the component of the torque that
changes the magnitude of the angular momentum is linearly proportional to
eccentricity, so resonant relaxation is much more efficient on eccentric orbits
than on circular orbits.

Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide.

However, the manual detection of lung nodules in LDCT images is time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Therefore, an automated system for lung nodule detection in LDCT images is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose an automated system for lung nodule detection in LDCT images using a deep learning approach. The proposed system consists of two main stages: candidate detection and false positive reduction. In the candidate detection stage, a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to detect potential nodules. Then, a false positive reduction stage is applied to remove non-nodule candidates using a combination of morphological operations and a 3D CNN classifier. The proposed system was evaluated on a publicly available dataset of LDCT images and achieved a sensitivity of 85.7% at 1 false positive per scan. The proposed system has the potential to assist radiologists in detecting lung nodules in LDCT images, leading to earlier diagnosis and improved patient outcomes.",2009-11-13,True

Biordered superconductivity and strong pseudogap state,"  Interrelation between the two-particle and mean-field problems is used to
describe the strong pseudogap and superconducting states in cuprates. We

spatial order observable in the superconducting state in the cuprates is
explained by a rise of the K - pair density wave. A competition between the
ODSRO and ODLRO states leads to the phase diagram typical of the cuprates.

Random Access Broadcast: Stability and Throughput Analysis,"  A wireless network in which packets are broadcast to a group of receivers

Evidence for Pre-SN Mass Loss in the Galactic SNR 3C 58,"  We discuss the findings of a comprehensive imaging and spectroscopic survey
of the optical emission associated with the supernova remnant 3C 58 (Fesen et
al. 2007) as they relate to the topic of pre-SN mass loss. Spectroscopically
measured radial velocities of ~450 emission knots within the remnant show two
distinct kinematic populations of optical knots: a high-velocity group with
radial velocities in the range of 700 - 1100 km/s and a lower velocity group
exhibiting radial expansion velocities below ~250 km/s. We interpret the
high-velocity knots as ejecta from the SN explosion and the low-velocity knots
as shocked circumstellar material likely resulting from pre-SN mass loss. The
chemical signatures of the two populations also show marked differences. The
high velocity group includes a substantial number of knots with notably higher
[N II]/H-alpha ratios not seen in the lower velocity population, suggesting
greater nitrogen enrichment in the SN ejecta than in the CSM. These results are

"Implications of ""peak oil"" for atmospheric CO2 and climate","  Unconstrained CO2 emission from fossil fuel burning has been the dominant
cause of observed anthropogenic global warming. The amounts of ""proven"" and
potential fossil fuel reserves are uncertain and debated. Regardless of the
true values, society has flexibility in the degree to which it chooses to
exploit these reserves, especially unconventional fossil fuels and those
located in extreme or pristine environments. If conventional oil production
peaks within the next few decades, it may have a large effect on future
atmospheric CO2 and climate change, depending upon subsequent energy choices.
Assuming that proven oil and gas reserves do not greatly exceed estimates of
the Energy Information Administration, and recent trends are toward lower
estimates, we show that it is feasible to keep atmospheric CO2 from exceeding
about 450 ppm by 2100, provided that emissions from coal, unconventional fossil
fuels, and land use are constrained. Coal-fired power plants without
sequestration must be phased out before mid-century to achieve this CO2 limit.
It is also important to ""stretch"" conventional oil reserves via energy
conservation and efficiency, thus averting strong pressures to extract liquid
fuels from coal or unconventional fossil fuels while clean technologies are
being developed for the era ""beyond fossil fuels"". We argue that a rising price
on carbon emissions is needed to discourage conversion of the vast fossil
resources into usable reserves, and to keep CO2 beneath the 450 ppm ceiling.

Nonlinear Evolution of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations,"  We study the nonlinear evolution of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in
the dark matter power spectrum and correlation function using renormalized
perturbation theory (RPT). In a previous paper we showed that RPT successfully
predicts the damping of acoustic oscillations; here we extend our calculation
to the enhancement of power due to mode-coupling. We show that mode-coupling
generates additional oscillations that are out of phase with those in the
linear spectrum, leading to shifts in the scales of oscillation nodes defined
with respect to a smooth spectrum. When Fourier transformed, these out of phase
oscillations induce percent-level shifts in the acoustic peak of the two-point
correlation function. We present predictions for these shifts as a function of
redshift; these should be considered as a robust lower limit to the more
realistic case that includes in addition redshift distortions and galaxy bias.
We show that these nonlinear effects occur at very large scales, leading to a
breakdown of linear theory at scales much larger than commonly thought. We
discuss why virialized halo profiles are not responsible for these effects,
which can be understood from basic physics of gravitational instability. Our
results are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations, and can be used
as a starting point for modeling BAO in future observations. To meet this end,

Exploring Continuous Tensegrities,"  A discrete tensegrity framework can be thought of as a graph in Euclidean
n-space where each edge is of one of three types: an edge with a fixed length
(bar) or an edge with an upper (cable) or lower (strut) bound on its length.
Roth and Whiteley, in their 1981 paper ""Tensegrity Frameworks"", showed that in
certain cases, the struts and cables can be replaced with bars when analyzing
the framework for infinitesimal rigidity. In that case we call the tensegrity
""bar equivalent"". In specific, they showed that if there exists a set of
positive weights, called a positive ""stress"", on the edges such that the
weighted sum of the edge vectors is zero at every vertex, then the tensegrity
is bar equivalent.
  In this paper we consider an extended version of the tensegrity framework in
which the vertex set is a (possibly infinite) set of points in Euclidean
n-space and the edgeset is a compact set of unordered pairs of vertices. These
are called ""continuous tensegrities"". We show that if a continuous tensegrity
has a strictly positive stress, it is bar equivalent and that it has a
semipositive stress if and only if it is partially bar equivalent. We also show
that if a tensegrity is minimally bar equivalent (it is bar equivalent but
removing any open set of edges makes it no longer so), then it has a strictly
positive stress.
  In particular, we examine the case where the vertices form a rectifiable
curve and the possible motions of the curve are limited to local isometries of
it. Our methods provide an attractive proof of the following result: There is
no locally arclength preserving motion of a circle that increases any antipodal
distance without decreasing some other one.

Deterministic characterization of stochastic genetic circuits,"  For cellular biochemical reaction systems where the numbers of molecules is
small, significant noise is associated with chemical reaction events. This
molecular noise can give rise to behavior that is very different from the
predictions of deterministic rate equation models. Unfortunately, there are few
analytic methods for examining the qualitative behavior of stochastic systems.
Here we describe such a method that extends deterministic analysis to include
leading-order corrections due to the molecular noise. The method allows the
steady-state behavior of the stochastic model to be easily computed,
facilitates the mapping of stability phase diagrams that include stochastic
effects and reveals how model parameters affect noise susceptibility, in a
manner not accessible to numerical simulation. By way of illustration we
consider two genetic circuits: a bistable positive-feedback loop and a
negative-feedback oscillator. We find in the positive feedback circuit that
translational activation leads to a far more stable system than transcriptional
control. Conversely, in a negative-feedback loop triggered by a
positive-feedback switch, the stochasticity of transcriptional control is
harnessed to generate reproducible oscillations.

Cascading Behavior in Large Blog Graphs,"  How do blogs cite and influence each other? How do such links evolve? Does
the popularity of old blog posts drop exponentially with time? These are some

  Blogs (weblogs) have become an important medium of information because of
their timely publication, ease of use, and wide availability. In fact, they
often make headlines, by discussing and discovering evidence about political
events and facts. Often blogs link to one another, creating a publicly

social network. Aggregating links from several blog posts creates a directed
graph which we analyze to discover the patterns of information propagation in
blogspace, and thereby understand the underlying social network. Not only are
blogs interesting on their own merit, but our analysis also sheds light on how
rumors, viruses, and ideas propagate over social and computer networks.
  Here we report some surprising findings of the blog linking and information
propagation structure, after we analyzed one of the largest available datasets,
with 45,000 blogs and ~ 2.2 million blog-postings. Our analysis also sheds
light on how rumors, viruses, and ideas propagate over social and computer

Topology of HI in the Large Magellanic Cloud,"  We have analyzed the HI aperture synthesis image of the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC), using an objective and quantitative measure of topology to
understand the HI distribution hosting a number of holes and clumps of various
sizes in the medium. The HI distribution shows different topology at four
different chosen scales. At the smallest scales explored (19-29 pc), the HI
mass is distributed in such a way that numerous clumps are embedded on top of a
low density background. At the larger scales from 73 to 194 pc, it shows a
generic hole topology. These holes might have been formed mainly by stellar
winds from hot stars. At the scales from 240 to 340 pc, slightly above the disk
scale-height of the gaseous disk, major clumps in the HI map change the
distribution to have a slight clump topology. These clumps include the giant
cloud associations in the spiral arms and the thick filaments surrounding
superholes. At the largest scales studied (390-485 pc), the hole topology is

Clump Lifetimes and the Initial Mass Function,"  Recent studies of dense clumps/cores in a number of regions of low-mass star

protostellar disk after the protostar forms. Radiation from the protostar
pushes the inner wall of the disk outward. The material agglomerates and forms
planets in radial sequence. The outer planets are formed slowly by classical
dynamical mechanisms acting in the snow zone. Planets have dense cores because
of agglomeration.
  Not one of the exoplanets discovered thus far is a planet. They are
cryptoplanets formed from matter ejected by protostars. When protostars have
excessive infall at high latitudes, they partially balance angular momentum
through outflow at the equator as they spin up. The ejected matter is trapped
in the magnetic torus formed between the star and the disk, like a tokamak. The
tokamak eventully reconnects and magnetic compression forms self-gravitating
remnants trapped and compressed by a closed spherical magnetic field,
spheromaks. Cooled spheromaks are cryptoplanets. They orbit near the star. They
can merge with each other or fall into the star or be ejected. They can grow by
accreting gas. They have a low density core and abundances characteristic of
the protostar. Their masses, radii, densities, and orbits are random, and are
inconsistent with the parameters for planets. They tend to have lower density
than planets.

"Mixed Hyperbolic - Second-Order Parabolic Formulations of General
  Relativity","  Two new formulations of general relativity are introduced. The first one is a
parabolization of the Arnowitt, Deser, Misner (ADM) formulation and is derived
by addition of combinations of the constraints and their derivatives to the
right-hand-side of the ADM evolution equations. The desirable property of this
modification is that it turns the surface of constraints into a local attractor
because the constraint propagation equations become second-order parabolic
independently of the gauge conditions employed. This system may be classified
as mixed hyperbolic - second-order parabolic. The second formulation is a
parabolization of the Kidder, Scheel, Teukolsky formulation and is a manifestly
mixed strongly hyperbolic - second-order parabolic set of equations, bearing
thus resemblance to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. As a first test,
a stability analysis of flat space is carried out and it is shown that the
first modification exponentially damps and smoothes all constraint violating
modes. These systems provide a new basis for constructing schemes for long-term
and stable numerical integration of the Einstein field equations.

Current status of Japanese detectors,"  Current status of TAMA and CLIO detectors in Japan is reported in this
article. These two interferometric gravitational-wave detectors are being
developed for the large cryogenic gravitational wave telescope (LCGT) which is
a future plan for detecting gravitational wave signals at least once per year.
  TAMA300 is being upgraded to improve the sensitivity in low frequency region

Control of mechanical systems on Lie groups and ideal hydrodynamics,"  In contrast to the Euler-Poincar{\'e} reduction of geodesic flows of left- or
right-invariant metrics on Lie groups to the corresponding Lie algebra (or its
dual), one can consider the reduction of the geodesic flows to the group
itself. The reduced vector field has a remarkable hydrodynamic interpretation:
it is a velocity field for a stationary flow of an ideal fluid. Right- or
left-invariant symmetry fields of the reduced field define vortex manifolds for
such flows.
  Consider now a mechanical system, whose configuration space is a Lie group
and whose Lagrangian is invariant to left translations on that group, and
assume that the mass geometry of the system may change under the action of
internal control forces. Such system can also be reduced to the Lie group. With
no controls, this mechanical system describes a geodesic flow of the
left-invariant metric, given by the Lagrangian, and thus its reduced flow is a
stationary ideal fluid flow on the Lie group. The standard control problem for
such system is to find the conditions, under which the system can be brought
from any initial position in the configuration space to another preassigned
position by changing its mass geometry. We show that under these conditions, by
changing the mass geometry, one can also bring one vortex manifold to any other
preassigned vortex manifold.

"Considering the Case for Biodiversity Cycles: Reexamining the Evidence
  for Periodicity in the Fossil Record","  Medvedev and Melott (2007) have suggested that periodicity in fossil
biodiversity may be induced by cosmic rays which vary as the Solar System
oscillates normal to the galactic disk. We re-examine the evidence for a 62
million year (Myr) periodicity in biodiversity throughout the Phanerozoic
history of animal life reported by Rohde & Mueller (2005), as well as related
questions of periodicity in origination and extinction. We find that the signal
is robust against variations in methods of analysis, and is based on
fluctuations in the Paleozoic and a substantial part of the Mesozoic.
Examination of origination and extinction is somewhat ambiguous, with results
depending upon procedure. Origination and extinction intensity as defined by RM
may be affected by an artifact at 27 Myr in the duration of stratigraphic
intervals. Nevertheless, when a procedure free of this artifact is implemented,
the 27 Myr periodicity appears in origination, suggesting that the artifact may
ultimately be based on a signal in the data. A 62 Myr feature appears in
extinction, when this same procedure is used. We conclude that evidence for a
periodicity at 62 Myr is robust, and evidence for periodicity at approximately
27 Myr is also present, albeit more ambiguous.

relativistic pairs from acceleration of externally-supplied particles in a
dormant outer gap or in situ ionization of the accreted neutral material in the
trapping region. The radiation belts can be disrupted by waves that are excited

(CTTSs). We combine these data with one previous field determination in order
to compare our observed field strengths with the field strengths predicted by
magnetospheric accretion models. We use literature data on the stellar mass,
radius, rotation period, and disk accretion rate to predict the field strength
that should be present on each of our stars according to these magnetospheric
accretion models. We show that our measured field values do not correlate with
the field strengths predicted by simple magnetospheric accretion theory. We
also use our field strength measurements and literature X-ray luminosity data
to test a recent relationship expressing X-ray luminosity as a function of
surface magnetic flux derived from various solar feature and main sequence star
measurements. We find that the T Tauri stars we have observed have weaker than
expected X-ray emission by over an order of magnitude on average using this
relationship. We suggest the cause for this is actually a result of the very
strong fields on these stars which decreases the efficiency with which gas
motions in the photosphere can tangle magnetic flux tubes in the corona.

The Magnetic Fields of Classical T Tauri Stars,"The research paper titled ""The Magnetic Fields of Classical T Tauri Stars"" aimed to investigate the magnetic fields of classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) using spectropolarimetric observations obtained with the ESPaDOnS and Narval instruments. The main objective was to determine the strength and geometry of the magnetic fields in these stars and study their impact on the accretion process.

The study found that the magnetic fields in CTTS are complex and have a wide range of strengths and geometries. The strength of the magnetic fields ranged from a few Gauss to several hundred Gauss, with the majority being in the range of 10-100 Gauss. The geometry of the magnetic fields varied from simple dipolar fields to more complex multipolar fields.

The study also found that the magnetic fields play a crucial role in the accretion process in CTTS. The magnetic fields control the funneling of material onto the star and regulate the accretion rate. The study showed that the accretion rate is correlated with the strength of the magnetic field, with higher accretion rates observed in stars with stronger magnetic fields.

In conclusion, the study provided a comprehensive analysis of the magnetic fields of CTTS and their impact on the accretion process. The results provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of young stars and the role of magnetic fields in these processes.",2009-06-23,True
"Optimal Routing for the Gaussian Multiple-Relay Channel with

La controverse de 1874 entre Camille Jordan et Leopold Kronecker,"  During the whole of 1874, Camille Jordan and Leopold Kronecker quar- relled
vigorously over the organisation of the theory of bilinear forms. That theory
promised a ""general"" and ""homogeneous"" treatment of numerous questions arising
in various 19th-century theoretical contexts, and it hinged on two theorems,
stated independently by Jordan and Weierstrass, that would today be considered
equivalent. It was, however, the perceived difference between those two
theorems that sparked the 1874 controversy. Focusing on this quarrel allows us
to explore the algebraic identity of the polynomial practices of the
manipulations of forms in use before the advent of structural approaches to
linear algebra. The latter approaches identified these practices with methods
for the classification of similar matrices. We show that the prac- tices --
Jordan's canonical reduction and Kronecker's invariant computation -- reflect
identities inseparable from the social context of the time. Moreover, these
practices reveal not only tacit knowledge, local ways of thinking, but also --
in light of a long history tracing back to the work of Lagrange, Laplace, Cau-
chy, and Hermite -- two internal philosophies regarding the significance of
generality which are inseparable from two disciplinary ideals opposing algebra
and arithmetic. By interrogating the cultural identities of such practices,
this study aims at a deeper understanding of the history of linear algebra

Geometry of PT-symmetric quantum mechanics,"  Recently, much research has been carried out on Hamiltonians that are not
Hermitian but are symmetric under space-time reflection, that is, Hamiltonians

probabilities are positive and the dynamical trajectories are unitary. However,
the geometrical structures that underlie quantum theories formulated in terms
of such Hamiltonians have hitherto not been fully understood. This paper

parity structure and analyses the characteristics of a PT-symmetric Hamiltonian

and a Hermitian operator is established. It is shown that the quadratic form
corresponding to the parity operator, in particular, gives rise to a natural
partition of the Hilbert space into two halves corresponding to states having

An absorption origin for the soft excess in Seyfert 1 AGN,"  (abridged) The soft excess seen in the X-ray spectra of many high mass
accretion rate AGN can be well modelled by reflection from a partially ionised
accretion disc. However, the derived parameters are often extreme, both in
terms of the underlying spacetime and the reflection geometry, and these models
require that the disc is far from hydrostatic equilibrium. An alternative model
uses similarly partially ionised, velocity smeared material but seen in
absorption, though again the derived velocities are extreme, requiring magnetic
driving (in the jet?) rather than a simple line driven disc wind. We find that
while both models give comparably good fits to XMM--Newton data, we favour the
absorption model as, unlike reflection, all the derived spectral indices are
soft. This is as expected by analogy with the correspondingly high mass
accretion rate stellar mass black holes. Furthermore, these X-ray spectra are
consistent with a one--to--one mapping between AGN type and spectral state,
with NLS1's having softer spectra corresponding to the very high state, while
the broad line AGN have Gamma~2 as expected for the high/soft state. We also
use the simultaneous OM data to derive the ratio of disc to total accretion
power which is another tracer of spectral state in X-ray binaries. This does
not always show that the disc in NLS1's contributes less than 80 per cent of
the total power, as expected for a very high state. We suggest that this is an
artifact of the standard disc models used to determine the disc luminosity in
our fits. The disc seen in the very high state of black hole binaries is often
observed to be distorted from the standard shape, and a similar effect in
NLS1's could recover the correspondance between black hole binary spectral
state and AGN type.

"Reconciliation of Zero-Point and Dark Energies in a Friedman Dust
  Universe with Einstein's Lambda","  In this paper, it is shown that the cosmological model that was introduced in
a sequence of three earlier papers under the title, A Dust Universe Solution to
the Dark Energy Problem, can be used to resolve the problem of the great
mismatch of numerical values between dark energy from cosmology and zero point
energy from quantum theory. It is shown that, if the zero point energies for
the cosmic microwave background and for all the rest of the universe that is
not cosmic microwave background are introduced into this model as two entities,
their separate values appear within this theory in the form of a numerical
difference. It is this difference that gives the numerical value for the zero
point value of Einstein's dark energy density. Consequently, although the two
zero point energies may be large, their difference can give the known small
dark energy value from cosmology for dark energy density. Issues relating to

Accurate QCD predictions for heavy-quark jets at the Tevatron and LHC,"  Heavy-quark jets are important in many of today's collider studies and
searches, yet predictions for them are subject to much larger uncertainties

jets, which is free of final-state logarithms to all orders and such that all
initial-state collinear logarithms can be resummed into the heavy-quark parton
distributions. Heavy-jet spectra can then be calculated in the massless
approximation, which is simpler than a massive calculation and reduces the
theoretical uncertainties by a factor of three. This provides the first ever

significant discriminatory power for the intrinsic charm content of the proton.

"Multidimensional supernova simulations with approximative neutrino
  transport. II. Convection and the advective-acoustic cycle in the supernova
  core","  By 2D hydrodynamic simulations including a detailed equation of state and
neutrino transport, we investigate the interplay between different non-radial
hydrodynamic instabilities that play a role during the postbounce accretion
phase of collapsing stellar cores. The convective mode of instability, which is
driven by negative entropy gradients caused by neutrino heating or by time
variations of the shock strength, can be identified clearly by the development
of typical Rayleigh-Taylor mushrooms. However, in cases where the gas in the
postshock region is rapidly advected towards the gain radius, the growth of
such a buoyancy instability can be suppressed. In such a situation the shocked
flow nevertheless can develop non-radial asymmetry with an oscillatory growth
of the amplitude. This phenomenon has been termed ``standing accretion shock
instability'' (SASI). It is shown here that the SASI oscillations can trigger
convective instability and like the latter they lead to an increase of the
average shock radius and of the mass in the gain layer. Both hydrodynamic
instabilities in combination stretch the advection time of matter through the
neutrino-heating layer and thus enhance the neutrino energy deposition in
support of the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. A rapidly contracting and
more compact nascent NS turns out to be favorable for explosions, because the
accretion luminosity and neutrino heating are larger and the growth rate of the
SASI is higher. Moreover, we show that the oscillation period of the SASI and a
variety of other features in our simulations agree with estimates for the
advective-acoustic cycle (AAC), in which perturbations are carried by the
accretion flow from the shock to the neutron star and pressure waves close an
amplifying global feedback loop. (abridged)

biologically realistic conditions? Here we answer both questions by studying an
attractor neural network in which inhibition and excitation balance each other.
Using mean field analysis, we derive a three-variable description of attractor
networks. From this description it follows that irregular firing can exist only
if the number of neurons involved in a memory is large. The same mean field
analysis also shows that the number of memories that can be stored in a network

km/s wide component, probably corresponding to the CIV for helium, is
pervasive. The 34 km/s wide linewidth family is found in low-velocity (local)
neutral hydrogen (HI) profiles as well as in the so-called high-velocity
clouds. In addition, published studies of HI linewidths found in the Magellanic
Stream, Very-High-Velocity Clouds, and Compact High-Velocity Clouds, all of

Diffuse cosmic gamma-rays at 1-20 MeV: A trace of the dark matter?,"  Several independent observations of the galactic core suggest hitherto
unexplained sources of energy. The most well known case is the 511 keV line
which has proven very difficult to explain with conventional astrophysical
positron sources. A similar, but less well known mystery is the excess of
gamma-ray photons detected by COMPTEL across a broad energy range 1-20 MeV.
Such photons are found to be very difficult to produce via known astrophysical
sources. We show in this work that dark matter in the form of dense antimatter
droplets provides a natural explanations for the observed flux of gamma-rays in
the 1-20 MeV range. We argue thatsuch photons must always accompany the 511 keV
line as they produced by the same mechanism within our framework. We calculate
the spectrum and intensity of the 1-20 MeV gamma-rays, and find it to be
consistent with the COMPTEL data.

"Ages for illustrative field stars using gyrochronology: viability,
  limitations and errors","  We here develop an improved way of using a rotating star as a clock, set it
using the Sun, and demonstrate that it keeps time well. This technique, called
gyrochronology, permits the derivation of ages for solar- and late-type main
sequence stars using only their rotation periods and colors. The technique is
clarified and developed here, and used to derive ages for illustrative groups
of nearby, late-type field stars with measured rotation periods. We first
demonstrate the reality of the interface sequence, the unifying feature of the
rotational observations of cluster and field stars that makes the technique
possible, and extends it beyond the proposal of Skumanich by specifying the
mass dependence of rotation for these stars. We delineate which stars it cannot
currently be used on. We then calibrate the age dependence using the Sun. The
errors are propagated to understand their dependence on color and period.
Representative age errors associated with the technique are estimated at ~15%
(plus possible systematic errors) for late-F, G, K, & early-M stars. Ages
derived via gyrochronology for the Mt. Wilson stars are shown to be in good
agreement with chromospheric ages for all but the bluest stars, and probably
superior. Gyro ages are then calculated for each of the active main sequence
field stars studied by Strassmeier and collaborators where other ages are not
available. These are shown to be mostly younger than 1Gyr, with a median age of
365Myr. The sample of single, late-type main sequence field stars assembled by
Pizzolato and collaborators is then assessed, and shown to have gyro ages
ranging from under 100Myr to several Gyr, and a median age of 1.2Gyr. Finally,

Converting genetic network oscillations into somite spatial pattern,"  In most vertebrate species, the body axis is generated by the formation of
repeated transient structures called somites. This spatial periodicity in
somitogenesis has been related to the temporally sustained oscillations in
certain mRNAs and their associated gene products in the cells forming the
presomatic mesoderm. The mechanism underlying these oscillations have been
identified as due to the delays involved in the synthesis of mRNA and
translation into protein molecules [J. Lewis, Current Biol. {\bf 13}, 1398
(2003)]. In addition, in the zebrafish embryo intercellular Notch signalling
couples these oscillators and a longitudinal positional information signal in
the form of an Fgf8 gradient exists that could be used to transform these
coupled temporal oscillations into the observed spatial periodicity of somites.
Here we consider a simple model based on this known biology and study its
consequences for somitogenesis. Comparison is made with the known properties of
somite formation in the zebrafish embryo . We also study the effects of

We show that the timing and duration of the oscillations are also important factors in determining the final somite pattern. Our results suggest that the genetic network regulating somite formation is highly sensitive to small changes in its parameters, indicating a robust and precise system. These findings provide insight into the mechanistic basis of somite formation and have implications for understanding the development of other complex biological systems.",2009-11-13,True

nearly no effect on the estimators, we show that taking into account the ISW
strongly decreases our ability to detect the topological signal. We also study

"Influence of Orbital Behaviour and Chaos on the Shape of Dark Matter
  Halos","  It has been shown that the dissipative gas infall during galaxy formation has
the capability to modify the shape of dark matter halos. In this paper we
perform the first detailed analysis of particle orbits in a cosmological dark
matter halos to understand {\it how} and {\it why} baryons alter its shape. We
perform a series of numerical experiments where we grow a baryonic core inside
a live dark matter halo extracted from a cosmological simulation. We follow the
orbits of more than 300 particles with more that 50000 timesteps. Our results
clearly show that the dissipational component is responsible for repeatedly
deflecting orbits which visit often the center of the system. Moreover the
gravitational potential time dependence associated with the growth of the
baryonic mass, shifts the frequencies of the orbits, making them extremely
chaotic. This randomization makes the orbits explore a large phase space. When
this effect takes place for a significant number of orbits it will be
manifested in the density distribution as an approach to a rounder
configuration. As a consequence, the influence of the central mass on the shape
of the phase space decreases with increasing distance from the center. We

Detection of superhumps in the VY Scl-type nova-like variable KR Aur,"  We report on detection of negative superhumps in KR Aur which is the

is put on the flexibility of the model, as to its possible extensions and the
relaxation of some strong assumptions. We point out some open problems
regarding the prediction of the detailed shape of Zipf's rank plots, which may
be tackled by means of such extensions.

"Zipf's law and city sizes: A short tutorial review on multiplicative
  processes in urban growth","The research paper titled ""Zipf's law and city sizes: A short tutorial review on multiplicative processes in urban growth"" provides a tutorial on the application of Zipf's law to understand the patterns of urban growth. The primary objective of this paper is to explain Zipf's law and its relevance in urban growth modeling. The paper highlights the notable discoveries and conclusions drawn from the application of Zipf's law, such as the observation that the size distribution of cities obeys a power-law, that urban growth is a multiplicative process, and that the parameters of the power-law distribution can provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of urban growth. The paper also explores the limitations of Zipf's law and suggests that it should be used in conjunction with other models to better understand the complex dynamics of urban growth. Overall, the paper provides a useful overview of Zipf's law and its application in urban growth modeling.",2007-05-23,True
The origin of X-ray emission from T Tauri stars,"  Several aspects concerning the origin of the very strong X-ray activity of T
Tauri Stars (TTS) are still not well understood. Important new insight came
recently from the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP), a unique 10-day long
Chandra observation of the Orion Nebula Cluster, and the XMM-Newton Extended
Survey of the Taurus Molecular Cloud (XEST). Based mainly on the results of
these two large projects, I will discuss our current knowledge about the
location of the X-ray emitting structures in TTS, the nature of their coronal
magnetic fields, inferences for pre-main-sequence magnetic dynamos, and the
relation between accretion processes and X-ray emission.

The origin of X-ray emission from T Tauri stars,"The research paper titled ""The origin of X-ray emission from T Tauri stars"" investigates the source of X-ray emissions from young stars known as T Tauri stars. The study suggests that the X-ray emissions are caused by magnetic fields that are generated by the star's rotation and the presence of a surrounding disk of gas and dust. The researchers used observations from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory to study the emission from T Tauri stars and found that the X-rays are primarily generated in the star's corona, which is the outermost layer of the star's atmosphere. The findings of the study provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of young stars and their surrounding environments.",2007-05-23,True
"A new chaotic attractor in a basic multi-strain epidemiological model
  with temporary cross-immunity","  An epidemic multi-strain model with temporary cross-immunity shows chaos,
even in a previously unexpected parameter region. Especially dengue fever
models with strong enhanced infectivity on secondary infection have previously
shown deterministic chaos motivated by experimental findings of
antibody-dependent-enhancement (ADE). Including temporary cross-immunity in
such models, which is common knowledge among field researchers in dengue, we
find a deterministically chaotic attractor in the more realistic parameter
region of reduced infectivity on secondary infection (''inverse ADE'' parameter
region). This is realistic for dengue fever since on second infection people
are more likely to be hospitalized, hence do not contribute to the force of
infection as much as people with first infection.
  Our finding has wider implications beyond dengue in any multi-strain
epidemiological systems with altered infectivity upon secondary infection,
since we can relax the condition of rather high infectivity on secondary
infection previously required for deterministic chaos. For dengue the finding
of wide ranges of chaotic attractors open new ways to analysis of existing data
sets.

"A new chaotic attractor in a basic multi-strain epidemiological model
  with temporary cross-immunity",The research paper presents a new chaotic attractor in a multi-strain epidemiological model that incorporates temporary cross-immunity. The model considers the transmission dynamics of multiple strains of a disease in a population and the temporary immunity that arises from exposure to one strain. The study uses numerical simulations to demonstrate the existence of a chaotic attractor in the model with temporary cross-immunity. The results show that the chaotic behavior can arise due to the interaction between the cross-immunity and the transmission dynamics of the disease. The study concludes that the new chaotic attractor has important implications for understanding the dynamics of multiple strains of a disease and highlights the need for further research in this area.,2007-06-25,True
