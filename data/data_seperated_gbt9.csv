Are Advanced Potentials Anomalous?,"  Advanced electromagnetic potentials are indigenous to the classical Maxwell
theory. Generally however they are deemed undesirable and are forcibly
excluded, destroying the theory's inherent time-symmetry. We investigate the
reason for this, pointing out that it is not necessary and in some cases is
counter-productive. We then focus on the direct-action theory in which the
advanced and retarded contributions are present symmetrically, with no
opportunity to supplement the particular integral solution of the wave equation
with an arbitrary complementary function. One then requires a plausible
explanation for the observed broken symmetry that, commonly, is understood
cannot be met by the Wheeler-Feynman mechanism because the necessary boundary
condition cannot be satisfied in acceptable cosmologies. We take this
opportunity to argue that the boundary condition is already met by all
expanding cosmologies simply as a result of cosmological red-shift. A
consequence is that the cosmological and thermodynamic arrows of time can be
equated, the direct action version of EM is preferred, and that advanced
potentials are ubiquitous.

Percolation transition in networks with degree-degree correlation,"  We introduce an exponential random graph model for networks with a fixed
degree distribution and with a tunable degree-degree correlation. We then
investigate the nature of a percolation transition in the correlated network
with the Poisson degree distribution. It is found that negative correlation is
irrelevant in that the percolation transition in the disassortative network
belongs to the same universality class of the uncorrelated network. Positive
correlation turns out to be relevant. The percolation transition in the
assortative network is characterized by the non-diverging mean size of finite
clusters and power-law scalings of the density of the largest cluster and the
cluster size distribution in the non-percolating phase as well as at the
critical point. Our results suggest that the unusual type percolation
transition in the growing network models reported recently may be inherited

"A new Determination of the Extragalactic Background of Diffuse Gamma

Relaxation dynamics in fluids of platelike colloidal particles,"  The relaxation dynamics of a model fluid of platelike colloidal particles is
investigated by means of a phenomenological dynamic density functional theory.
The model fluid approximates the particles within the Zwanzig model of
restricted orientations. The driving force for time-dependence is expressed
completely by gradients of the local chemical potential which in turn is
derived from a density functional -- hydrodynamic interactions are not taken
into account. These approximations are expected to lead to qualitatively
reliable results for low densities as those within the isotropic-nematic
two-phase region. The formalism is applied to model an initially spatially
homogeneous stable or metastable isotropic fluid which is perturbed by
switching a two-dimensional array of Gaussian laser beams. Switching on the
laser beams leads to an accumulation of colloidal particles in the beam
centers. If the initial chemical potential and the laser power are large enough
a preferred orientation of particles occurs breaking the symmetry of the laser
potential. After switching off the laser beams again the system can follow
different relaxation paths: It either relaxes back to the homogeneous isotropic
state or it forms an approximately elliptical high-density core which is
elongated perpendicular to the dominating orientation in order to minimize the
surface free energy. For large supersaturations of the initial isotropic fluid
the high-density cores of neighboring laser beams of the two-dimensional array
merge into complex superstructures.

Non-topological solitons in field theories with kinetic self-coupling,"  We investigate some fundamental features of a class of non-linear

"Effective inverse spectral problem for rational Lax matrices and
  applications","  We reconstruct a rational Lax matrix of size R+1 from its spectral curve (the
desingularization of the characteristic polynomial) and some additional data.

we provide a residue-formula for the entries of the Lax matrix in terms of
bases of dual differentials of weights nu and 1-nu respectively. All objects
are described in the most explicit terms using Theta functions. Via a sequence
of ``elementary twists'', we construct sequences of Lax matrices sharing the
same spectral curve and polar structure and related by conjugations by rational
matrices. Particular choices of elementary twists lead to construction of
sequences of Lax matrices related to finite--band recurrence relations (i.e.
difference operators) sharing the same shape. Recurrences of this kind are
satisfied by several types of orthogonal and biorthogonal polynomials. The
relevance of formulae obtained to the study of the large degree asymptotics for

An Energy Efficiency Perspective on Training for Fading Channels,"  In this paper, the bit energy requirements of training-based transmission
over block Rayleigh fading channels are studied. Pilot signals are employed to
obtain the minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) estimate of the channel fading
coefficients. Energy efficiency is analyzed in the worst case scenario where
the channel estimate is assumed to be perfect and the error in the estimate is
considered as another source of additive Gaussian noise. It is shown that bit
energy requirement grows without bound as the snr goes to zero, and the minimum
bit energy is achieved at a nonzero snr value below which one should not
operate. The effect of the block length on both the minimum bit energy and the
snr value at which the minimum is achieved is investigated. Flash training
schemes are analyzed and shown to improve the energy efficiency in the low-snr

Performance Analysis for Multichannel Reception of OOFSK Signaling,"  In this paper, the error performance of on-off frequency shift keying (OOFSK)
modulation over fading channels is analyzed when the receiver is equipped with
multiple antennas. The analysis is conducted in two cases: the coherent
scenario where the fading is perfectly known at the receiver, and the
noncoherent scenario where neither the receiver nor the transmitter knows the
fading coefficients. For both cases, the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP)
detection rule is derived and analytical probability of error expressions are
obtained. The effect of fading correlation among the receiver antennas is also
studied. Simulation results indicate that for sufficiently low duty cycle
values, lower probability of error values with respect to FSK signaling are
achieved. Equivalently, when compared to FSK modulation, OOFSK with low duty
cycle requires less energy to achieve the same probability of error, which
renders this modulation a more energy efficient transmission technique.

"G\""odel Incompleteness and the Black Hole Information Paradox","  Semiclassical reasoning suggests that the process by which an object
collapses into a black hole and then evaporates by emitting Hawking radiation

information paradox. Further, there seems to be no unique prediction of where

latter aspect of the paradox may be a manifestation of an inconsistent
self-reference in the semiclassical theory of black hole evolution. This
suggests the inadequacy of the semiclassical approach or, at worst, that
standard quantum mechanics and general relavity are fundamentally incompatible.
One option for the resolution for the paradox in the localization is to
identify the G\""odel-like incompleteness that corresponds to an imposition of
consistency, and introduce possibly new physics that supplies this
incompleteness. Another option is to modify the theory in such a way as to

Galactic B and late-O stars. We use a new technique which employs stellar

the central position of the 2175 A extinction bump is mildly variable, its
width is highly variable, and the two variations are unrelated. (2) Strong
correlations are found among some extinction properties within the UV region,

curves are not correlated with each other. (4) The large sightline-to-sightline
variation seen in our sample implies that any average Galactic extinction curve
will always reflect the biases of its parent sample. (5) The use of an average
curve to deredden a spectral energy distribution (SED) will result in
significant errors, and a realistic error budget for the dereddened SED must
include the observed variance of Galactic curves. While the observed large
sightline-to-sightline variations, and the lack of correlation among the

Accreting Neutron Stars in Low-Mass X-Ray Binary Systems,"  Using the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RossiXTE), astronomers have discovered
that disk-accreting neutron stars with weak magnetic fields produce three
distinct types of high-frequency X-ray oscillations. These oscillations are
powered by release of the binding energy of matter falling into the strong
gravitational field of the star or by the sudden nuclear burning of matter that
has accumulated in the outermost layers of the star. The frequencies of the
oscillations reflect the orbital frequencies of gas deep in the gravitational
field of the star and/or the spin frequency of the star. These oscillations can
therefore be used to explore fundamental physics, such as strong-field gravity
and the properties of matter under extreme conditions, and important
astrophysical questions, such as the formation and evolution of millisecond
pulsars. Observations using RossiXTE have shown that some two dozen neutron
stars in low-mass X-ray binary systems have the spin rates and magnetic fields
required to become millisecond radio-emitting pulsars when accretion ceases,
but that few have spin rates above about 600 Hz. The properties of these stars
show that the paucity of spin rates greater than 600 Hz is due in part to the
magnetic braking component of the accretion torque and to the limited amount of
angular momentum that can be accreted in such systems. Further study will show
whether braking by gravitational radiation is also a factor. Analysis of the
kilohertz oscillations has provided the first evidence for the existence of the
innermost stable circular orbit around dense relativistic stars that is

Quantitative relations between corruption and economic factors,"  We report quantitative relations between corruption level and economic

"Dark energy constraints from cosmic shear power spectra: impact of
  intrinsic alignments on photometric redshift requirements","  Cosmic shear constrains cosmology by exploiting the apparent alignments of
pairs of galaxies due to gravitational lensing by intervening mass clumps.
However galaxies may become (intrinsically) aligned with each other, and with
nearby mass clumps, during their formation. This effect needs to be
disentangled from the cosmic shear signal to place constraints on cosmology. We
use the linear intrinsic alignment model as a base and compare it to an
alternative model and data. If intrinsic alignments are ignored then the dark
energy equation of state is biased by ~50 per cent. We examine how the number
of tomographic redshift bins affects uncertainties on cosmological parameters
and find that when intrinsic alignments are included two or more times as many
bins are required to obtain 80 per cent of the available information. We
investigate how the degradation in the dark energy figure of merit depends on
the photometric redshift scatter. Previous studies have shown that lensing does
not place stringent requirements on the photometric redshift uncertainty, so
long as the uncertainty is well known. However, if intrinsic alignments are
included the requirements become a factor of three tighter. These results are
quite insensitive to the fraction of catastrophic outliers, assuming that this
fraction is well known. We show the effect of uncertainties in photometric
redshift bias and scatter. Finally we quantify how priors on the intrinsic
alignment model would improve dark energy constraints.

Beyond Caustic Crossings: Properties of Binary Microlensing Light Curves,"  Binary microlensing light curves have a variety of morphologies. Many are
indistinguishable from point lens light curves. Of those that deviate from the

photometric uncertainty and sampling should find at least as many non-caustic
crossing binary lens events as caustic crossing events; in future surveys with
more sensitive photometry, the contribution of distinctive non-caustic crossing
events will be even greater. To try to explain why caustic crossing light

Topological insulators beyond the Brillouin zone via Chern parity,"  The topological insulator is an electronic phase stabilized by spin-orbit
coupling that supports propagating edge states and is not adiabatically
connected to the ordinary insulator. In several ways it is a spin-orbit-induced
analogue in time-reversal-invariant systems of the integer quantum Hall effect
(IQHE). This paper studies the topological insulator phase in disordered
two-dimensional systems, using a model graphene Hamiltonian introduced by Kane

insulator given here is distinct from previous efforts in that it involves
boundary phase twists that couple only to charge, does not refer to edge
states, and can be measured by pumping cycles of ordinary charge. In this
definition, the phase of a Slater determinant of electronic states is
determined by a Chern parity analogous to Chern number in the IQHE case.
Numerically we find, in agreement with recent network model studies, that the
direct transition between ordinary and topological insulators that occurs in
band structures is a consequence of the perfect crystalline lattice.
Generically these two phases are separated by a metallic phase, which is
allowed in two dimensions when spin-orbit coupling is present. The same

Non-abelian plasma instabilities for strong anisotropy,"  We numerically investigate gauge field instabilities in anisotropic SU(2)
plasmas using weak field initial conditions. The growth of unstable modes is

The stability of poloidal magnetic fields in rotating stars,"  The stability of large-scale magnetic fields in rotating stars is explored,
using 3D numerical hydrodynamics to follow the evolution of an initial poloidal
field. It is found that the field is subject to an instability, located
initially on the magnetic equator, whereby the gas is displaced in a direction
parallel to the magnetic axis. If the magnetic axis is parallel to the rotation
axis, the rotation does not affect the initial linear growth of the
instability, but does restrict the growth of the instability outside of the
equatorial zone. The magnetic energy decays on a timescale which is a function
of the Alfv\'en crossing time and the rotation speed, but short compared to any
evolutionary timescale. No evidence is found for a possible stable end state to

Neutral genetic drift can aid functional protein evolution,"  BACKGROUND: Many of the mutations accumulated by naturally evolving proteins
are neutral in the sense that they do not significantly alter a protein's
ability to perform its primary biological function. However, new protein
functions evolve when selection begins to favor other, ""promiscuous"" functions
that are incidental to a protein's biological role. If mutations that are
neutral with respect to a protein's primary biological function cause
substantial changes in promiscuous functions, these mutations could enable
future functional evolution.
  RESULTS: Here we investigate this possibility experimentally by examining how
cytochrome P450 enzymes that have evolved neutrally with respect to activity on
a single substrate have changed in their abilities to catalyze reactions on
five other substrates. We find that the enzymes have sometimes changed as much
as four-fold in the promiscuous activities. The changes in promiscuous
activities tend to increase with the number of mutations, and can be largely
rationalized in terms of the chemical structures of the substrates. The
activities on chemically similar substrates tend to change in a coordinated
fashion, potentially providing a route for systematically predicting the change
in one function based on the measurement of several others.
  CONCLUSIONS: Our work suggests that initially neutral genetic drift can lead
to substantial changes in protein functions that are not currently under
selection, in effect poising the proteins to more readily undergo functional
evolution should selection ""ask new questions"" in the future.

Using Images to create a Hierarchical Grid Spatial Index,"  This paper presents a hybrid approach to spatial indexing of two dimensional

Spin-polarized transport in II-VI magnetic resonant tunneling devices,"  We investigate electronic transport through II-VI semiconductor resonant

other configurations. First, we further increase the magnetic field, which
leads to a spin polarization of the electronic current injected from the leads,
thus giving rise to a relative change in the current amplitude. We demonstrate
that the spin polarization in the emitter can be determined from such a change.
Furthermore, in the case of a magnetically doped injector our model shows a

Photodesorption of CO ice,"  At the high densities and low temperatures found in star forming regions, all
molecules other than H2 should stick on dust grains on timescales shorter than
the cloud lifetimes. Yet these clouds are detected in the millimeter lines of
gaseous CO. At these temperatures, thermal desorption is negligible and hence a
non-thermal desorption mechanism is necessary to maintain molecules in the gas
phase. Here, the first laboratory study of the photodesorption of pure CO ice
under ultra high vacuum is presented, which gives a desorption rate of 3E-3 CO
molecules per UV (7-10.5 eV) photon at 15 K. This rate is factors of 1E2-1E5
larger than previously estimated and is comparable to estimates of other
non-thermal desorption rates. The experiments constrains the mechanism to a
single photon desorption process of ice surface molecules. The measured
efficiency of this process shows that the role of CO photodesorption in
preventing total removal of molecules in the gas has been underestimated.

steep velocity gradients, characterising both upward and downward supersonic
motions, which are time variable on time scales of a few hundred days. These

Roughness induced boundary slip in microchannel flows,"  Surface roughness becomes relevant if typical length scales of the system are
comparable to the scale of the variations as it is the case in microfluidic

origin in the assumption of perfectly smooth boundaries. We investigate the
problem by means of lattice Boltzmann (LB) simulations and introduce an
``effective no-slip plane'' at an intermediate position between peaks and
valleys of the surface. Our simulations show good agreement with analytical
results for sinusoidal boundaries, but can be extended to arbitrary geometries

close orbiting extrasolar giant planet HD 75289b. We obtained ~230 spectra in
the wavelength range 2.18 - 2.19 microns using the Phoenix spectrograph at
Gemini South. By considering the direct spectrum, derived from irradiated model
atmospheres, we search for the absorption profile signature present in the

J1128+592: a highly variable IDV source,"  Short time-scale radio variations of compact extragalactic radio quasars and

"Resonant forcing of select degrees of freedom of multidimensional
  chaotic map dynamics","  We study resonances of multidimensional chaotic map dynamics. We use the
calculus of variations to determine the additive forcing function that induces
the largest response, that is, the greatest deviation from the unperturbed
dynamics. We include the additional constraint that only select degrees of
freedom be forced, corresponding to a very general class of problems in which
not all of the degrees of freedom in an experimental system are accessible to
forcing. We find that certain Lagrange multipliers take on a fundamental
physical role as the efficiency of the forcing function and the effective
forcing experienced by the degrees of freedom which are not forced directly.
Furthermore, we find that the product of the displacement of nearby
trajectories and the effective total forcing function is a conserved quantity.
We demonstrate the efficacy of this methodology with several examples.

"Two-dimensional transport and transfer of a single atomic qubit in
  optical tweezers","  Quantum computers have the capability of out-performing their classical
counterparts for certain computational problems. Several scalable quantum
computing architectures have been proposed. An attractive architecture is a
large set of physically independant qubits, arranged in three spatial regions
where (i) the initialized qubits are stored in a register, (ii) two qubits are
brought together to realize a gate, and (iii) the readout of the qubits is
performed. For a neutral atom-based architecture, a natural way to connect
these regions is to use optical tweezers to move qubits within the system. In
this letter we demonstrate the coherent transport of a qubit, encoded on an

Information flow and optimization in transcriptional control,"  In the simplest view of transcriptional regulation, the expression of a gene
is turned on or off by changes in the concentration of a transcription factor

Realizing this optimal information capacity would require that the dynamic
range of TF concentrations used by the cell, the input/output relation of the
regulatory module, and the noise levels of binding and transcription satisfy
certain matching relations. This parameter-free prediction is in good agreement
with recent experiments on the Bicoid/Hunchback system in the early Drosophila

dominate the evolution of the magnetically supported surface layers. The disk
photosphere is complex, with large density inhomogeneities at both the
scattering and effective (thermalization) photospheres of the evolving
horizontally-averaged structure. Both the dominant magnetic support and the

Nonlocality of a single particle,"  There has been a great deal of debate surrounding the issue of whether it is
possible for a single photon to exhibit nonlocality. A number of schemes have

"Symmetric and asymmetric solitons in linearly coupled Bose-Einstein
  condensates trapped in optical lattices","  We study spontaneous symmetry breaking in a system of two parallel
quasi-one-dimensional traps, equipped with optical lattices (OLs) and filled
with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The cores are linearly coupled by
tunneling. Analysis of the corresponding system of linearly coupled
Gross-Pitaevskii equations (GPEs) reveals that spectral bandgaps of the single
GPE split into subgaps. Symmetry breaking in two-component BEC solitons is
studied in cases of the attractive (AA) and repulsive (RR) nonlinearity in both
traps; the mixed situation, with repulsion in one trap and attraction in the
other (RA), is considered too. In all the cases, stable asymmetric solitons are
found, bifurcating from symmetric or antisymmetric ones (and destabilizing
them), in the AA and RR systems, respectively. In either case, bi-stability is
predicted, with a nonbifurcating stable branch, either antisymmetric or
symmetric, coexisting with asymmetric ones. Solitons destabilized by the
bifurcation tend to rearrange themselves into their stable asymmetric
counterparts. The impact of a phase mismatch, between the OLs in the two cores
is also studied. Also considered is a related model, for a binary BEC in a
single-core trap with the OL, assuming that the two species (representing
different spin states of the same atom) are coupled by linear interconversion.
In that case, the symmetry-breaking bifurcations in the AA and RR models switch
their character, if the inter-species nonlinear interaction becomes stronger
than the intra-species nonlinearity.

Enhanced negative type for finite metric trees,"  Finite metric trees are known to have strict 1-negative type. In this paper
we introduce a new family of inequalities that quantify the extent of the
""strictness"" of the 1-negative type inequalities for finite metric trees. These
inequalities of ""enhanced 1-negative type"" are sufficiently strong to imply
that any given finite metric tree must have strict p-negative type for all
values of p in an open interval that contains the number 1. Moreover, these
open intervals can be characterized purely in terms of the unordered
distribution of edge weights that determine the path metric on the particular
tree, and are therefore largely independent of the tree's internal geometry.
  From these calculations we are able to extract a new non linear technique for
improving lower bounds on the maximal p-negative type of certain finite metric
spaces. Some pathological examples are also considered in order to stress
certain technical points.

"Edges and Switches, Tunnels and Bridges","""Edges and Switches, Tunnels and Bridges"" is a research paper that explores the architecture of the human brain and how it processes information. The paper's main objective is to investigate the brain's ability to switch between different mental states, such as task-focused and mind-wandering, and the neural pathways that facilitate these transitions.

The researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the brain activity of participants as they performed a task that required them to switch between different mental states. They found that the brain's ability to switch between states was facilitated by two distinct neural pathways: a ""tunnel"" pathway that allows for fast and efficient switching between states, and a ""bridge"" pathway that allows for more gradual transitions between states.

Additionally, the researchers found that the brain's ability to switch between states was influenced by the presence of external stimuli and internal thought processes. For example, the brain was more likely to switch states when presented with a task that required attention, and less likely to switch states during periods of mind-wandering.

Overall, the paper's findings suggest that the human brain is capable of flexible and efficient switching between different mental states, and that this ability is facilitated by distinct neural pathways.",2009-07-09,True

Mean-Field Magnetohydrodynamics of Accretion Disks,"  We consider the accretion process in a disk with magnetic fields that are
dragged in from the interstellar medium by gravitational collapse. Two
diffusive processes are at work in the system: (1) ""viscous"" torques exerted by
turbulent and magnetic stresses, and (2) ""resistive"" redistribution of mass
with respect to the magnetic flux arising from the imperfect conduction of
current. In steady state, self-consistency between the two rates of drift
requires that a relationship exists between the coefficients of turbulent
viscosity and turbulent resistivity. Ignoring any interactions with a stellar
magnetosphere, we solve the steady-state equations for a magnetized disk under
the gravitational attraction of a mass point and threaded by an amount of
magnetic flux consistent with calculations of magnetized gravitational collapse
in star formation. Our model mean-field equations have an exact analytical
solution that corresponds to magnetically diluted Keplerian rotation about the
central mass point. The solution yields the strength of the magnetic field and
the surface density as functions of radial position in the disk and their
connection with the departure from pure Keplerian rotation in representative
cases. We compare the predictions of the theory with the available observations
concerning T Tauri stars, FU Orionis stars, and low- and high-mass protostars.
Finally, we speculate on the physical causes for high and low states of the
accretion disks that surround young stellar objects. One of the more important

"Bayesian reconstruction of the cosmological large-scale structure:

from a Bayesian perspective. For a linear data model, a number of known and
novel reconstruction schemes, which differ in terms of the underlying signal
prior, data likelihood, and numerical inverse extra-regularization schemes are
derived and classified. The Bayesian methodology presented in this paper tries
to unify and extend the following methods: Wiener-filtering, Tikhonov
regularization, Ridge regression, Maximum Entropy, and inverse regularization
techniques. The inverse techniques considered here are the asymptotic
regularization, the Jacobi, Steepest Descent, Newton-Raphson,
Landweber-Fridman, and both linear and non-linear Krylov methods based on
Fletcher-Reeves, Polak-Ribiere, and Hestenes-Stiefel Conjugate Gradients. The
structures of the up-to-date highest-performing algorithms are presented, based
on an operator scheme, which permits one to exploit the power of fast Fourier
transforms. Using such an implementation of the generalized Wiener-filter in
the novel ARGO-software package, the different numerical schemes are
benchmarked with 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional problems including structured white
and Poissonian noise, data windowing and blurring effects. A novel numerical
Krylov scheme is shown to be superior in terms of performance and fidelity.
These fast inverse methods ultimately will enable the application of sampling
techniques to explore complex joint posterior distributions. We outline how the

power spectrum can jointly be investigated by a Gibbs-sampling process. Such a
method can be applied for the redshift distortions correction of the observed

Phenomenology of the nMSSM from colliders to cosmology,"  Low energy supersymmetric models provide a solution to the hierarchy problem

issues in cosmology: the origin of dark matter and baryonic matter. One of the
most attractive features of this framework is that the relevant physical

Quasars Lensed by Globular Clusters of Spiral and Elliptical Galaxies,"  Based on the SDSS catalog, we have found new close quasar-galaxy pairs.
Quasars projected onto the halos of nearer galaxies are encountered among the
multitude of quasars observed at various distances from us. Among them there

also in redshift. Such quasar-galaxy pairs are called close pairs. We developed
further the hypothesis that such pairs appear, because the fluxer on the
nucleus of the more distant galaxy passes through halo globular clusters of the
nearer galaxy,resulting in magnification and splitting of the image of the
source that we interpret as a quasar. To corroborate this hypothesis, we
analyzed the distribution of quasars in the plane of the halos of these
galaxies. The quasars from close pairs were found to follow the density profile
of globular clusters in the halos of elliptical and spiral galaxies with slopes

SDSSJ104341.53+085558.2: A second white dwarf with a gaseous debris disc,"  Intermediate resolution spectroscopy of the white dwarf
SDSSJ104341.53+085558.2 contains double-peaked emission lines of
CaII8498,8542,8662 and identifies this object to be the second single white

recently discovered SDSSJ1228+1040. A photospheric Magnesium abundance of 0.3
times the solar value, determined from the observed MgII4481 absorption line,
implies that the white dwarf is accreting from the circumstellar material. The
absence of Balmer emission lines and of photospheric HeI4471 absorption
indicates that the accreted material is depleted in volatile elements and, by
analogy with SDSS1228+1040, may be the result of the tidal disruption of an

display strong infrared flux excess, thought to be originating in a

WD1337+705 is, as SDSS1228+1040 and SDSS1043+0855, moderately hot, but has the
lowest Mg abundance of those three stars, suggesting a possible correlation

Parallel Transport and Functors,"  Parallel transport of a connection in a smooth fibre bundle yields a functor
from the path groupoid of the base manifold into a category that describes the

notions we introduce: local trivializations and smooth descent data. This
provides a way to substitute categories of functors for categories of smooth
fibre bundles with connection. We indicate that this concept can be generalized

Parallel Transport and Functors,"The research paper titled ""Parallel Transport and Functors"" by Peter W. Michor explores the concept of parallel transport and functors in differential geometry. The main objective of the paper is to establish a connection between the two concepts and to demonstrate their usefulness in various settings, including Riemannian geometry, gauge theory, and geometric mechanics.

The paper begins by introducing the concept of parallel transport, which is the process of transporting a vector or tensor along a curve without changing its direction. The author then goes on to discuss the mathematical framework of functors, which are mappings between categories that preserve certain properties.

The paper establishes a connection between parallel transport and functors by showing that parallel transport can be understood as a functor between the category of curves and the category of vector or tensor fields. The author then applies this concept to various settings, such as Riemannian geometry, where the functorial approach is used to define the Levi-Civita connection, and gauge theory, where it is used to define the connection on a principal bundle.

The paper concludes by demonstrating the usefulness of the functorial approach in geometric mechanics, where it is used to define the notion of a covariant derivative on the space of curves. The author also discusses the potential for further research in this area, including the study of functors between more general categories and their applications in other areas of mathematics and physics.

In summary, the paper establishes a connection between parallel transport and functors in differential geometry and demonstrates their usefulness in various settings. The paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of mathematics and opens up new avenues for research in this area.",2014-08-26,True

"A cold metal-poor cloud traced by a weak MgII absorption at z~0.45.
  First detection of SiI, CaI and FeI in a QSO absorber","  We present the observations of a weak MgII absorption system detected at
z~0.452 in the UVES high resolution spectrum of the QSO HE0001-2340. The weaker
of the two MgII components forming the system shows associated absorptions due
to SiI, CaI and FeI observed for the first time in a QSO spectrum. We
investigate the nature of this absorber by comparing its properties with those
of different classes of absorbers (weak MgII, Damped Ly-alpha systems and local
interstellar clouds) and reproducing its ionization conditions with
photoionization models. The observed absorber belongs to the class of weak MgII
systems on the basis of its equivalent width, however the relative strength of
commonly observed transitions deviates significantly from those of the above
mentioned absorbers. A rough estimate of the probability to cross such a system
with a QSO line of sight is P~0.03. The presence of rare neutral transitions
suggests that the cloud is shielded by a large amount of neutral hydrogen. A
detailed comparison of the observed column densities with the average
properties of damped Ly-alpha systems and local interstellar cold clouds shows,
in particular, deficient MgII/MgI and CaII/CaI ratios in our cloud. The results
of photoionization models indicate that the cloud could be ionized by the UV
background. However, a simple model of a single cloud with uniform density
cannot reproduce the observed ionic abundance ratios, suggesting a more complex
density structure for the absorber. Supposing that ionization corrections are
negligible, the most puzzling result is the underabundance of magnesium with

Modified p-modes in penumbral filaments?,"  Aims: The primary objective of this study is to search for and identify wave

Radio-frequency discharges in Oxygen. Part 1: Modeling,"  In this series of three papers we present results from a combined
experimental and theoretical effort to quantitatively describe capacitively
coupled radio-frequency discharges in oxygen. The particle-in-cell Monte-Carlo
model on which the theoretical description is based will be described in the
present paper. It treats space charge fields and transport processes on an
equal footing with the most important plasma-chemical reactions. For given
external voltage and pressure, the model determines the electric potential
within the discharge and the distribution functions for electrons, negatively
charged atomic oxygen, and positively charged molecular oxygen. Previously used
scattering and reaction cross section data are critically assessed and in some
cases modified. To validate our model, we compare the densities in the bulk of
the discharge with experimental data and find good agreement, indicating that
essential aspects of an oxygen discharge are captured.

Particle-based modeling of oxygen discharges,"  We present an one-dimensional particle-in-cell Monte-Carlo model for
capacitively coupled radio-frequency discharges in oxygen. The model

distribution functions for electrons, negatively charged atomic oxygen, and
positively charged molecular oxygen. Previously used collision cross sections
are critically assessed and in some cases modified. Provided associative
detachment due to metastable oxygen molecules is included in the model, the
electro-negativities in the center of the discharge are in excellent agreement

"Effective attraction induced by repulsive interaction in a spin-transfer
  system","  In magnetic systems with dominating easy-plane anisotropy the magnetization
can be described by an effective one dimensional equation for the in-plane
angle. Re-deriving this equation in the presence of spin-transfer torques, we
obtain a description that allows for a more intuitive understanding of
spintronic devices' operation and can serve as a tool for finding new dynamic
regimes. A surprising prediction is obtained for a planar ``spin-flip
transistor'': an unstable equilibrium point can be stabilized by a current
induced torque that further repels the system from that point. Stabilization by
repulsion happens due to the presence of dissipative environment and requires a
Gilbert damping constant that is large enough to ensure overdamped dynamics at
zero current.

"Vibration-Induced Conductivity Fluctuation Measurement for Soil Bulk
  Density Analysis","  Soil bulk density affects water storage, water and nutrient movement, and
plant root activity in the soil profile. Its measurement is difficult in field
conditions. Vibration-induced conductivity fluctuation was investigated to
quantify soil bulk density with possible field applications in the future. The
AC electrical conductivity of soil was measured using a pair of blade-like
electrodes while exposing the soil to periodic vibration. The blades were
positioned longitudinally and transversally to the direction of the induced
vibration to enable the calculation of a normalized index. The normalized index
was expected to provide data independent from the vibration strength and to
reduce the effect of soil salinity and water content. The experiment was
conducted on natural and salinized fine sand at two moisture conditions and
four bulk densities. The blade-shaped electrodes improved electrode-soil
contact compared to cylindrical electrodes, and thereby, reduced measurement
noise. Simulations on a simplified resistor lattice indicate that the
transversal effect increases as soil bulk density decreases. Measurement of dry
sand showed a negative correlation between the normalized conductivity
fluctuation and soil bulk density for both longitudinal and transversal
settings. The decrease in the transversal signal was smaller than expected. The
wet natural and salinized soils performed very similarly as hypothesized, but
their normalized VICOF response was not significant to bulk density changes.

slight ambiguity concerning the bias operator. The third part in devoted to the
powerful framework of Dirichlet forms whose main feature is to apply easily to
infinite dimensional models including the Wiener space (giving an
interpretation of Malliavin calculus in terms of errors), the Poisson space and
the Monte Carlo space. In the fourth part we show how an error in the usual

Orthogonality catastrophe and Kondo effect in graphene,"  Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe in graphene, at energies close to the
Dirac point, is analyzed. It is shown that, in clean systems, the orthogonality
catastrophe is suppressed, due to the vanishing density of states at the Dirac
point. In the presence of preexisting localized states at the Dirac energy, the
orthogonality catastrophe shows similar features to those found in normal
metals with a finite density of states at the Fermi level. The implications for
the Kondo effect induced by magnetic impurities, and for the Fermi edge
singularities in tunneling processes are also discussed.

Black Hole Accretion in Low States: Electron Heating,"  Plasmas in an accretion flow are heated by MHD turbulence generated through
the magneto-rotational instability. The viscous stress driving the accretion is
intimately connected to the microscopic processes of turbulence dissipation. We
show that, in a few well-observed black hole accretion systems, there is
compelling observational evidence of efficient electron heating by turbulence
or collective plasma effects in low accretion states, when Coulomb collisions
are not efficient enough to establish a thermal equilibrium between electrons
and ions at small radii. However, charged particles reach a thermal equilibrium
with their kind much faster than with others through Coulomb collisions, a
two-temperature accretion flow is expected. We consider a Keplerian accretion
flow with a constant mass accretion rate in the pseudo-Newtonian gravitational
potential and take into account the bremsstrahlung, synchrotron, and inverse
Comptonization cooling processes. The critical mass accretion rate, below which
the two-temperature solution may exist, is determined by the cooling processes
and the collisional energy exchanges between electrons and ions and has very
weak dependence on the collision-less heating of electrons by turbulence, which
becomes more important at lower accretion rates. Collision-less heating of
electrons by MHD turbulence can no longer be ignored in quantitative
investigations of these systems.

Tuning the conductance of a molecular switch,"  The ability to control the conductance of single molecules will have a major
impact in nanoscale electronics. Azobenzene, a molecule that changes
conformation as a result of a trans/cis transition when exposed to radiation,
could form the basis of a light-driven molecular switch. It is therefore
crucial to clarify the electrical transport characteristics of this molecule.
Here, we investigate theoretically charge transport in a system in which a
single azobenzene molecule is attached to two carbon nanotubes. In clear
contrast to gold electrodes, the nanotubes can act as true nanoscale electrodes
and we show that the low-energy conduction properties of the junction may be
dramatically modified by changing the topology of the contacts between the
nanotubes and the molecules, and/or the chirality of the nanotubes (that is,
zigzag or armchair). We propose experiments to demonstrate controlled
electrical switching with nanotube electrodes.

"Dependence of the Local Reionization History on Halo Mass and
  Environment: Did Virgo Reionize the Local Group?","  The reionization of the Universe has profound effects on the way galaxies
form and on their observed properties at later times. Of particular importance
is the relative timing of the reionization history of a region and its halo
assembly history, which can affect the nature of the first stars formed in that
region, the properties and radial distribution of its stellar halo, globular
cluster population and its satellite galaxies. We distinguish two basic cases
for the reionization of a halo - internal reionization, whereby the stars
forming in situ reionize their host galaxy, and external reionization, whereby
the progenitor of a galaxy is reionized by external radiation before its own
stars are able to form in sufficient numbers. We use a set of large-scale
radiative transfer and structure formation simulations, based on cosmologies
derived from both WMAP 1-year and WMAP 3-year data, to evaluate the mean
reionization redshifts and the probability of internal/external reionization
for Local Group-like systems, galaxies in the field and central cD galaxies in
clusters. We find that these probabilities are strongly dependent on the
underlying cosmology and the efficiency of photon production, but also on the
halo mass. There is a rapid transition between predominantly external and
predominantly internal reionization at a mass scale of 1.0e12 Msun
(corresponding roughly to L*galaxies), with haloes less massive than this being
reionized preferentially from distant sources. We provide a fit for the
reionization redshift as a function of halo mass, which could be helpful to
parameterize reionization in semi-analytical models of galaxy formation on
cosmological scales. We find no statistical correlation between the
reionization history of field galaxies and their environment.

incompatibility between model fits to X-ray surface brightness profiles and
those done with SZE profiles. Since observational SZE radial profiles are in
short supply, the X-ray parameters are often used in SZE analysis. We show that
this leads to biased estimates of the integrated Compton y-parameter inside

Fundamental Parameters of He-Weak and He-Strong Stars,"  We carried out low resolution spectroscopic observations in the wavelength
range 3400-4700 A of 20 He-weak and 8 He-strong stars to determine their
fundamental parameters by means of the Divan-Chalonge-Barbier (BCD)
spectrophotometric system. For a few He-weak stars we also estimate the
effective temperatures and the angular diameters by integrating absolute fluxes
observed over a wide spectral range. Non-LTE model calculations are carried out
to study the influence of the He/H abundance ratio on the emergent radiation of
He-strong stars and on their Teff determination. We find that the effective
temperatures, surface gravities and bolometric absolute magnitudes of He-weak
stars estimated with the BCD system and the integrated flux method are in good
agreement between each other, and they also agree with previous determinations
based on several different methods. The mean discrepancy between the visual
absolute magnitudes derived using the Hipparcos parallaxes and the BCD values
is on average 0.3 mag for He-weak stars, while it is 0.5 mag for He-strong
stars. For He-strong stars, we note that the BCD calibration, based on stars in
the solar environment, leads to overestimated values of Teff. By means of model
atmosphere calculations with enhanced He/H abundance ratios we show that larger
He/H ratios produce smaller BD which naturally explains the Teff
overestimation. We take advantage of these calculations to introduce a method
to estimate the He/H abundance ratio in He-strong stars. The BD of HD 37479
