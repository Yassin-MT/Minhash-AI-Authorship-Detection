Fixed Phase Quantum Search Algorithm,"  Building quantum devices using fixed operators is a must to simplify the
hardware construction. Quantum search engine is not an exception. In this
paper, a fixed phase quantum search algorithm that searches for M matches in an
unstructured search space of size N will be presented. Selecting phase shifts
of 1.91684\pi in the standard amplitude amplification will make the technique
perform better so as to get probability of success at least 99.58% in
O(sqrt(N/M)) better than any know fixed operator quantum search algorithms. The
algorithm will be able to handle either a single match or multiple matches in
the search space. The algorithm will find a match in O(sqrt(N/M)) whether the
number of matches is known or not in advance.

Improving immunization strategies,"  We introduce an immunization method where the percentage of required
vaccinations for immunity are close to the optimal value of a targeted
immunization scheme of highest degree nodes. Our strategy retains the advantage
of being purely local, without the need of knowledge on the global network
structure or identification of the highest degree nodes. The method consists of
selecting a random node and asking for a neighbor that has more links than
himself or more than a given threshold and immunizing him. We compare this
method to other efficient strategies on three real social networks and on a
scale-free network model, and find it to be significantly more effective.

Constraints on the Very Early Universe from Thermal WIMP Dark Matter,"  We investigate the relic density n_\chi of non-relativistic long-lived or
stable particles \chi in non-standard cosmological scenarios. We calculate the
relic abundance starting from arbitrary initial temperatures of the
radiation-dominated epoch, and derive the lower bound on the initial
temperature T_0 \geq m_\chi/23, assuming that thermally produced \chi particles
account for the dark matter energy density in the universe; this bound holds
for all \chi annihilation cross sections. We also investigate cosmological
scenarios with modified expansion rate. Even in this case an approximate
formula similar to the standard one is capable of predicting the final relic
abundance correctly. Choosing the \chi annihilation cross section such that the
observed cold dark matter abundance is reproduced in standard cosmology, we
constrain possible modifications of the expansion rate at T \sim m_\chi/20,
well before Big Bang nucleosynthesis.

Flavour-Dependent Type II Leptogenesis,"  We reanalyse leptogenesis via the out-of-equilibrium decay of the lightest
right-handed neutrino in type II seesaw scenarios, taking into account
flavour-dependent effects. In the type II seesaw mechanism, in addition to the
type I seesaw contribution, an additional direct mass term for the light
neutrinos is present. We consider type II seesaw scenarios where this
additional contribution arises from the vacuum expectation value of a Higgs
triplet, and furthermore an effective model-independent approach. We
investigate bounds on the flavour-specific decay asymmetries, on the mass of
the lightest right-handed neutrino and on the reheat temperature of the early
universe, and compare them to the corresponding bounds in the type I seesaw
framework. We show that while flavour-dependent thermal type II leptogenesis
becomes more efficient for larger mass scale of the light neutrinos, and the
bounds become relaxed, the type I seesaw scenario for leptogenesis becomes more
constrained. We also argue that in general, flavour-dependent effects cannot be
ignored when dealing with leptogenesis in type II seesaw models.

Numerical estimation of critical parameters using the Bond entropy,"  Using a model of spinless fermions in a lattice with nearest neighbor and
next-nearest neighbor interaction we show that the entropy of the reduced two

easy to calculate numerical indicator for the critical parameters of the
quantum phase transition when the basic ordering pattern has a two-site
periodicity. The actual behavior of the bond entropy depends on the particular

phase transition from a Luttinger liquid phase to a charge density wave state
the bond entropy has a local maximum while in the transition from the Luttinger
liquid to the phase separated state the derivative of the bond entropy has a

"Measuring energy dependent polarization in soft gamma-rays using Compton
  scattering in PoGOLite","  Linear polarization in X- and gamma-rays is an important diagnostic of many
astrophysical sources, foremost giving information about their geometry,
magnetic fields, and radiation mechanisms. However, very few X-ray polarization
measurements have been made, and then only mono-energetic detections, whilst
several objects are assumed to have energy dependent polarization signatures.
In this paper we investigate whether detection of energy dependent polarization
from cosmic sources is possible using the Compton technique, in particular with
the proposed PoGOLite balloon-experiment, in the 25-100 keV range. We use
Geant4 simulations of a PoGOLite model and input photon spectra based on Cygnus
X-1 and accreting magnetic pulsars (100 mCrab). Effective observing times of 6
and 35 hours were simulated, corresponding to a standard and a long duration
flight respectively. Both smooth and sharp energy variations of the
polarization are investigated and compared to constant polarization signals
using chi-square statistics. We can reject constant polarization, with energy,
for the Cygnus X-1 spectrum (in the hard state), if the reflected component is
assumed to be completely polarized, whereas the distinction cannot be made for
weaker polarization. For the accreting pulsar, constant polarization can be
rejected in the case of polarization in a narrow energy band with at least 50%

Burgers Turbulence,"  The last decades witnessed a renewal of interest in the Burgers equation.

"Analytical evaluation of the X-ray scattering contribution to imaging
  degradation in grazing-incidence X-ray telescopes","  The focusing performance of X-ray optics (conveniently expressed in terms of
HEW, Half Energy Width) strongly depend on both mirrors deformations and photon
scattering caused by the microroughness of reflecting surfaces. In particular,
the contribution of X-ray Scattering (XRS) to the HEW of the optic is usually
an increasing function H(E) of the photon energy E. Therefore, in future hard
X-ray imaging telescopes of the future (SIMBOL-X, NeXT, Constellation-X, XEUS),
the X-ray scattering could be the dominant problem since they will operate also
in the hard X-ray band (i.e. beyond 10 keV). [...]
  Several methods were proposed in the past years to estimate the scattering
contribution to the HEW, dealing with the surface microroughness expressed in
terms of its Power Spectral Density (PSD), on the basis of the well-established
theory of X-ray scattering from rough surfaces. We faced that problem on the
basis on the same theory, but we tried a new approach: the direct, analytical
translation of a given surface roughness PSD into a H(E) trend, and - vice
versa - the direct translation of a H(E) requirement into a surface PSD. This
PSD represents the maximum tolerable microroughness level in order to meet the
H(E) requirement in the energy band of a given X-ray telescope.
  We have thereby found a new, analytical and widely applicable formalism to
compute the XRS contribution to the HEW from the surface PSD, provided that the
PSD had been measured in a wide range of spatial frequencies. The inverse
problem was also solved, allowing the immediate evaluation of the mirror
surface PSD from a measured function H(E). The same formalism allows
establishing the maximum allowed PSD of the mirror in order to fulfill a given
H(E) requirement. [...]

High-resolution study of a star-forming cluster in the Cep-A HW2 region,"  Due to its relatively small distance (725 pc), the Cepheus A East
star-forming region is an ideal laboratory to study massive star formation
processes. Based on its morphology, it has been suggested that the flattened
molecular gas distribution around the YSO HW2 may be a 350-AU-radius massive
protostellar disk. Goal of our work is to ascertain the nature of this
structure. We have employed the Plateau de Bure Interferometer to acquire
(sub-)arcsecond-resolution imaging of high-density and shock tracers, such as
methyl cyanide (CH3CN) and silicon monoxide (SiO), towards the HW2 position. On
the 1-arcsecond (about 725 AU) scale, the flattened distribution of molecular
gas around HW2 appears to be due to the projected superposition, on the plane
of the sky, of at least three protostellar objects, of which at least one is
powering a molecular outflow at a small angle with respect to the line of
sight. The presence of a protostellar disk around HW2 is not ruled out, but

"Thin elastic shells with variable thickness for lithospheric flexure of
  one-plate planets","  Planetary topography can either be modeled as a load supported by the
lithosphere, or as a dynamical effect due to lithospheric flexure caused by
mantle convection. In both cases the response of the lithosphere to external
forces can be calculated with the theory of thin elastic plates or shells. On
one-plate planets the spherical geometry of the lithospheric shell plays an
important role in the flexure mechanism. So far the equations governing the
deformations and stresses of a spherical shell have only been derived under the
assumption of a shell of constant thickness. However local studies of gravity
and topography data suggest large variations in the thickness of the
lithosphere. In this article we obtain the scalar flexure equations governing
the deformations of a thin spherical shell with variable thickness or variable
Young's modulus. The resulting equations can be solved in succession, except
for a system of two simultaneous equations, the solutions of which are the
transverse deflection and an associated stress function. In order to include
bottom loading generated by mantle convection, we extend the method of stress
functions to include loads with a toroidal tangential component. We further
show that toroidal tangential displacement always occurs if the shell thickness
varies, even in the absence of toroidal loads. We finally prove that the
degree-one harmonic components of the transverse deflection and of the toroidal
tangential displacement are independent of the elastic properties of the shell
and are associated with translational and rotational freedom. The flexure
equations for a shell of variable thickness are useful not only for the
prediction of the gravity signal in local admittance studies, but also for the
construction of stress maps in tectonic analysis.

Detection of single electron spin resonance in a double quantum dot,"  Spin-dependent transport measurements through a double quantum dot are a
valuable tool for detecting both the coherent evolution of the spin state of a
single electron as well as the hybridization of two-electron spin states. In
this paper, we discuss a model that describes the transport cycle in this
regime, including the effects of an oscillating magnetic field (causing
electron spin resonance) and the effective nuclear fields on the spin states in
the two dots. We numerically calculate the current flow due to the induced spin
flips via electron spin resonance and we study the detector efficiency for a
range of parameters. The experimental data are compared with the model and we
find a reasonable agreement.

Donor type semiconductor at low temperature as maser active medium,"  In some semiconductors donor impurity atoms can attract additional electrons,

Parity doubling in particle physics,"  Parity doubling in excited hadrons is reviewed. Parity degeneracy in hadrons

on light mesons caused much excitement and renewed interest to the phenomenon,
which still remains to be enigmatic. The present retrospective review is an

(Regge theory and dynamical symmetries) and end up with the latest trends
(manifestations of broader degeneracies and AdS/QCD). We show the evolution of
various ideas about parity doubling. The experimental evidence for this

"Collective excitations of hard-core Bosons at half filling on square and
  triangular lattices: Development of roton minima and collapse of roton gap","  We study ground state properties and excitation spectra for hard-core Bosons

of short-range density order at the antiferromagnetic wavevector, and
simultaneously a roton minima in the density excitation spectra. On the
square-lattice, the model maps on to the well studied XXZ model, and the roton
gap collapses to zero precisely at the Heisenberg symmetry point, leading to
the well known spectra for the Heisenberg antiferromagnet. On the
triangular-lattice, the collapse of the roton gap signals the onset of the

"Temperature-driven transition from the Wigner Crystal to the
  Bond-Charge-Density Wave in the Quasi-One-Dimensional Quarter-Filled band","  It is known that within the interacting electron model Hamiltonian for the
one-dimensional 1/4-filled band, the singlet ground state is a Wigner crystal
only if the nearest neighbor electron-electron repulsion is larger than a
critical value. We show that this critical nearest neighbor Coulomb interaction
is different for each spin subspace, with the critical value decreasing with
increasing spin. As a consequence, with the lowering of temperature, there can
occur a transition from a Wigner crystal charge-ordered state to a spin-Peierls
state that is a Bond-Charge-Density Wave with charge occupancies different from
the Wigner crystal. This transition is possible because spin excitations from
the spin-Peierls state in the 1/4-filled band are necessarily accompanied by
changes in site charge densities. We apply our theory to the 1/4-filled band
quasi-one-dimensional organic charge-transfer solids in general and to 2:1
tetramethyltetrathiafulvalene (TMTTF) and tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene
(TMTSF) cationic salts in particular. We believe that many recent experiments

several members of the TMTTF family. We explain the occurrence of two different
antiferromagnetic phases but a single spin-Peierls state in the generic phase
diagram for the 2:1 cationic solids. The antiferromagnetic phases can have

Neutrino-cooled accretion and GRB variability,"  For accretion rates Mdot~0.1 Msun/s to a few solar mass black hole the inner

Stochastic fluctuations in metabolic pathways,"  Fluctuations in the abundance of molecules in the living cell may affect its
growth and well being. For regulatory molecules (e.g., signaling proteins or

Specifically, we focus on the metabolic network, which is highly inter-linked,

analogy between the dynamics of a linear metabolic pathway and that of the
exactly soluable linear queueing network or, alternatively, a mass transfer
system, we derive a plethora of results concerning fluctuations in the
abundance of intermediate metabolites in various common motifs of the metabolic
network. For all but one case examined, we find the steady-state fluctuation in
different nodes of the pathways to be effectively uncorrelated. Consequently,
fluctuations in enzyme levels only affect local properties and do not propagate
elsewhere into metabolic networks, and intermediate metabolites can be freely
shared by different reactions. Our approach may be applicable to study
metabolic networks with more complex topologies, or protein signaling networks

Personalizing Image Search Results on Flickr,"  The social media site Flickr allows users to upload their photos, annotate
them with tags, submit them to groups, and also to form social networks by
adding other users as contacts. Flickr offers multiple ways of browsing or
searching it. One option is tag search, which returns all images tagged with a
specific keyword. If the keyword is ambiguous, e.g., ``beetle'' could mean an
insect or a car, tag search results will include many images that are not
relevant to the sense the user had in mind when executing the query. We claim
that users express their photography interests through the metadata they add in
the form of contacts and image annotations. We show how to exploit this
metadata to personalize search results for the user, thereby improving search
performance. First, we show that we can significantly improve search precision
by filtering tag search results by user's contacts or a larger social network
that includes those contact's contacts. Secondly, we describe a probabilistic
model that takes advantage of tag information to discover latent topics
contained in the search results. The users' interests can similarly be

Resummed Cross Section for Jet Production at Hadron Colliders,"  We study the resummation of large logarithmic perturbative corrections to the
single-inclusive jet cross section at hadron colliders. The corrections we
address arise near the threshold for the partonic reaction, when the incoming
partons have just enough energy to produce the high-transverse-momentum final

most closely corresponds to the situation in experiment. Matching our results

carbon nanotubes (CNTs), grown on a metallic substrate in the form of a thin
film for field emission under diode configuration. Despite high output, the

Demographics of Transition Objects,"  The unusual properties of transition objects (young stars with an optically
thin inner disc surrounded by an optically thick outer disc) suggest that
significant disc evolution has occured in these systems. We explore the nature
of these systems by examining their demographics, specifically their stellar
accretion rates (Mdot) and disc masses (Mdisc) compared to those of accreting T
Tauri stars of comparable age. We find that transition objects in Taurus occupy
a restricted region of the Mdot vs. Mdisc plane. Compared to non-transition
single stars in Taurus, they have stellar accretion rates that are typically
~10 times lower at the same disc mass and median disc masses ~4 times larger.
These properties are anticipated by several proposed planet formation theories
and suggest that the formation of Jovian mass planets may play a significant
role in explaining the origin of at least some transition objects. Considering
transition objects as a distinct demographic group among accreting T Tauri

"The Sedentary Survey of Extreme High Energy Peaked BL Lacs III. Results

well-defined sample of highly X-ray dominated BL Lacertae objects (HBLs) which
includes 150 sources. In this paper, the third of the series, we report the
results of a dedicated optical spectroscopy campaign that, together with
results from other independent optical follow up programs, led to the
spectroscopic identification of all sources in the sample. We carried out a
systematic spectroscopic campaign for the observation of all unidentified
objects of the sample using the ESO 3.6m, the KPNO 4m, and the TNG optical
telescopes. We present new identifications and optical spectra for 76 sources,
50 of which are new BL Lac objects, 18 are sources previously referred as BL
Lacs but for which no redshift information was available, and 8 are broad
emission lines AGNs. We find that the multi-frequency selection technique used
to build the survey is highly efficient (about 90%) in selecting BL Lacs
objects. We present positional and spectroscopic information for all confirmed
BL Lac objects. Our data allowed us to determined 36 redshifts out of the 50
new BL Lacs and 5 new redshifts for the previously known objects. The redshift
distribution of the complete sample is presented and compared with that of
other BL Lacs samples. For 26 sources without recognizable absorption features,
we calculated lower limits to the redshift using a method based on simulated
optical spectra with different ratios between jet and galaxy emission. For a
subsample of 38 object with high-quality spectra, we find a correlation between
the optical spectral slope, the 1.4 GHz radio luminosity, and the Ca H&K break

astrophysics have seen gradual recognition that elastodynamic approach to the
continuum mechanics of nuclear matter provides proper account of macroscopic

"Detection of a 1258 Hz high-amplitude kilohertz quasi-periodic
  oscillation in the ultra-compact X-ray binary 1A 1246-588","  We have observed the ultra-compact low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) 1A 1246-588
with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). In this manuscript we report the
discovery of a kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in 1A 1246-588. The
kilohertz QPO was only detected when the source was in a soft high-flux state
reminiscent of the lower banana branch in atoll sources. Only one kilohertz QPO
peak is detected at a relatively high frequency of 1258+-2 Hz and at a single
trial significance of more than 7 sigma. Kilohertz QPOs with a higher frequency
have only been found on two occasions in 4U 0614+09. Furthermore, the frequency
is higher than that found for the lower kilohertz QPO in any source, strongly
suggesting that the QPO is the upper of the kilohertz QPO pair often found in
LMXBs. The full-width at half maximum is 25+-4 Hz, making the coherence the
highest found for an upper kilohertz QPO. From a distance estimate of ~6 kpc
from a radius expansion burst we derive that 1A 1246-588 is at a persistent
flux of ~0.2-0.3 per cent of the Eddington flux, hence 1A 1246-588 is one of
the weakest LMXBs for which a kilohertz QPO has been detected. The
root-mean-square (rms) amplitude in the 5-60 keV band is 27+-3 per cent, this
is the highest for any kilohertz QPO source so far, in line with the general
anti-correlation between source luminosity and rms amplitude of the kilohertz
QPO peak identified before. Using the X-ray spectral information we produce a
colour-colour diagram. The source behaviour in this diagram provides further
evidence for the atoll nature of the source.

Information Theoretic Proofs of Entropy Power Inequalities,"  While most useful information theoretic inequalities can be deduced from the
basic properties of entropy or mutual information, up to now Shannon's entropy
power inequality (EPI) is an exception: Existing information theoretic proofs
of the EPI hinge on representations of differential entropy using either Fisher
information or minimum mean-square error (MMSE), which are derived from de
Bruijn's identity. In this paper, we first present an unified view of these
proofs, showing that they share two essential ingredients: 1) a data processing
argument applied to a covariance-preserving linear transformation; 2) an
integration over a path of a continuous Gaussian perturbation. Using these
ingredients, we develop a new and brief proof of the EPI through a mutual
information inequality, which replaces Stam and Blachman's Fisher information
inequality (FII) and an inequality for MMSE by Guo, Shamai and Verd\'u used in
earlier proofs. The result has the advantage of being very simple in that it
relies only on the basic properties of mutual information. These ideas are then
generalized to various extended versions of the EPI: Zamir and Feder's
generalized EPI for linear transformations of the random variables, Takano and
Johnson's EPI for dependent variables, Liu and Viswanath's

"Assessment and Propagation of Input Uncertainty in Tree-based Option
  Pricing Models","  This paper aims to provide a practical example on the assessment and
propagation of input uncertainty for option pricing when using tree-based

that option prices are as unknown as the inputs they are based on. Option
pricing formulas are tools whose validity is conditional not only on how close
the model represents reality, but also on the quality of the inputs they use,
and those inputs are usually not observable. We provide three alternative
frameworks to calibrate option pricing tree models, propagating parameter
uncertainty into the resulting option prices. We finally compare our methods
with classical calibration-based results assuming that there is no options

"Subdiffusion and weak ergodicity breaking in the presence of a reactive

a reactive boundary with finite reaction rate. Molecular crowding conditions,
that are found to cause subdiffusion of larger molecules in biological cells,
are shown to effect long-tailed distributions with identical exponent for both
the unbinding times from the boundary to the bulk and the rebinding times from
the bulk. This causes a weak ergodicity breaking: typically, an individual
particle either stays bound or remains in the bulk for very long times. We
discuss why this may be beneficial for in vivo gene regulation by DNA-binding

of these effects and identify it with a finite phase velocity associated with
the moving frame. We define this phase velocity by analogy to the de Broglie
wave associated with a moving particle. Based on this construct we demonstrate
that the phase of the de Broglie waves further extended for stationary
particles is a relativistic invariant being the same for all corresponding
observers. Also the phase of the electromagnetic waves transporting energy at

"On the Mapping of Time-Dependent Densities onto Potentials in Quantum

critically examined. The issue is of significance ever since Runge and Gross

forming a theoretical basis for time-dependent density functional theory. We
argue that besides existence (so called v-representability) and uniqueness
there is an important question of stability and chaos. Studying a 2-level
system we find innocent, almost constant densities that cannot be constructed
from any potential (non-existence). We further show via a Lyapunov analysis
that the mapping of densities on potentials has chaotic regions in this case.
In real space the situation is more subtle. V-representability is formally
assured but the mapping is often chaotic making the actual construction of the
potential almost impossible. The chaotic nature of the mapping, studied for the

Chiral Mechanisms Leading to Orbital Quantum Structures in the Nucleon,"  Color confinement and chiral symmetry specify some important territory for

composite system of qurks and gluons, the fundamental fields of qcd, while the
landscape of the hadronic spectrum is dominated by the fact that two quark
flavors, u and d, are characterized by masses small compared to the fundamental
scale of this theory. Measurements sensitive to the orbital angular momenta of
the color constituents of the nucleon display the interplay of chiral dynamics

evaluation, within the context of the Georgi-Manohar chiral quark model, of the
normalization of the orbital structure functions and the normalization of the
Boer-Mulders functions for different quark flavors. The resolution structures
in the chiral quark model represent an evaluation of Collins functions for a

Intrinsic ripples in graphene,"  The stability of two-dimensional (2D) layers and membranes is subject of a
long standing theoretical debate. According to the so called Mermin-Wagner
theorem, long wavelength fluctuations destroy the long-range order for 2D
crystals. Similarly, 2D membranes embedded in a 3D space have a tendency to be
crumpled. These dangerous fluctuations can, however, be suppressed by
anharmonic coupling between bending and stretching modes making that a
two-dimensional membrane can exist but should present strong height
fluctuations. The discovery of graphene, the first truly 2D crystal and the
recent experimental observation of ripples in freely hanging graphene makes
these issues especially important. Beside the academic interest, understanding
the mechanisms of stability of graphene is crucial for understanding electronic
transport in this material that is attracting so much interest for its unusual
Dirac spectrum and electronic properties. Here we address the nature of these
height fluctuations by means of straightforward atomistic Monte Carlo
simulations based on a very accurate many-body interatomic potential for
carbon. We find that ripples spontaneously appear due to thermal fluctuations
with a size distribution peaked around 70 \AA which is compatible with

"Tests of Bayesian Model Selection Techniques for Gravitational Wave
  Astronomy","  The analysis of gravitational wave data involves many model selection
problems. The most important example is the detection problem of selecting

Future space based detectors, such as the \emph{Laser Interferometer Space

which include two-way coupling between the phases at global mass loadings equal
to unity. The governing Eulerian equations are solved using pseudo-spectral
methods on up to 512**3 computional grid points. DNS results for particle
concentration and enstrophy at Taylor microscale Reynolds numbers in the range
34 - 170 were used to directly determine multiplier distributions (PDFs) on
spatial scales 3 times the Kolmogorov length scale. The width of the PDFs,
which is a measure of intermittency, decreases with increasing mass loading
within the local region where the multipliers are measured. The functional form
of this dependence is not sensitive to Reynolds numbers in the range
considered. A partition correlation probability is included in the cascade
model to account for the observed spatial anticorrelation between particle
concentration and enstrophy. Joint probability distribution functions of
concentration and enstrophy generated using the cascade model are shown to be
in excellent agreement with those derived directly from our 3D simulations.
Probabilities predicted by the cascade model are presented at Reynolds numbers
well beyond what is achievable by direct simulation. These results clearly
indicate that particle mass loading significantly reduces the probabilities of
high particle concentration and enstrophy relative to those resulting from
unloaded runs. Particle mass density appears to reach a limit at around 100

What is the order of 2D polymer escape transition?,"  An end-grafted flexible polymer chain in 3d space between two pistons
undergoes an abrupt transition from a confined coil to a flower-like
conformation when the number of monomers in the chain, N, reaches a critical
value. In 2d geometry, excluded volume interactions between monomers of a chain
confined inside a strip of finite length 2L transform the coil conformation
into a linear string of blobs. However, the blob picture raises questions on

"How Mergers May Affect The Mass Scaling Relations Between Black Holes,
  Galaxies, and Other Gravitationally Bound Systems","  Supermassive black hole (BH) masses (MBH) are strongly correlated with galaxy
stellar bulge masses (Mbulge) and there are several ideas to explain the origin
of this relationship. This study isolates the role of galaxy mergers from
considerations of other detailed physics to more clearly show how a linear
BH-galaxy mass relation (MBH-Mgal) can naturally emerge regardless of how
primordial BHs were seeded inside galaxies, if the galaxy mass function
declines with increasing mass. Under this circumstance, the MBH-Mgal relation
is a passive attractor that eventually converges to a tight linear relation
because of two basic statistical effects: a central limit-like tendency for
galaxy mergers which is much stronger for major mergers than minor mergers, and
a convergence toward a linear relation that is due mainly to minor mergers. A
curious consequence of this thought experiment is that, if galaxy bulges are
formed by major mergers, then merging statistics naturally show that MBH would
correlate more strongly with bulge dominated galaxies, because of stronger
central-seeking tendencies, than with disk dominated galaxies. Even if some
other physics is ultimately responsible for causing a linear MBH-Mbulge
relationship, this thought experiment shows that, counter to intuition, random
merging of galaxies that harbor random BH masses tends to strengthen rather
than weaken a pre-existing, linear, correlation. This idea may be generalized
to other gravitationally bound systems (dark matter halo, compact nuclear
objects) that retain their physical identities after experiencing mergers.

"Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory: Kinetic Potentials and Ab-Initio
  Local Pseudopotentials","  In the density functional (DF) theory of Kohn and Sham, the kinetic energy of
the ground state of a system of noninteracting electrons in a general external
field is calculated using a set of orbitals. Orbital free methods attempt to
calculate this directly from the electron density by approximating the
universal but unknown kinetic energy density functional. However simple local
approximations are inaccurate and it has proved very difficult to devise
generally accurate nonlocal approximations. We focus instead on the kinetic
potential, the functional derivative of the kinetic energy DF, which appears in
the Euler equation for the electron density. We argue that the kinetic
potential is more local and more amenable to simple physically motivated
approximations in many relevant cases, and describe two pathways by which the
value of the kinetic energy can be efficiently calculated. We propose two
nonlocal orbital free kinetic potentials that reduce to known exact forms for
both slowly varying and rapidly varying perturbations and also reproduce exact
results for the linear response of the density of the homogeneous system to
small perturbations. A simple and systematic approach for generating accurate
and weak ab-initio local pseudopotentials which produce a smooth slowly varying
valence component of the electron density is proposed for use in orbital free
DF calculations of molecules and solids. The use of these local
pseudopotentials further minimizes the possible errors from the kinetic
potentials. Our theory yields results for the total energies and ionization
energies of atoms, and for the shell structure in the atomic radial density
profiles that are in very good agreement with calculations using the full
Kohn-Sham theory.

"Evolution favors protein mutational robustness in sufficiently large
  populations","  BACKGROUND: An important question is whether evolution favors properties such
as mutational robustness or evolvability that do not directly benefit any
individual, but can influence the course of future evolution. Functionally
similar proteins can differ substantially in their robustness to mutations and
capacity to evolve new functions, but it has remained unclear whether any of
these differences might be due to evolutionary selection for these properties.
  RESULTS: Here we use laboratory experiments to demonstrate that evolution
favors protein mutational robustness if the evolving population is sufficiently
large. We neutrally evolve cytochrome P450 proteins under identical selection
pressures and mutation rates in populations of different sizes, and show that
proteins from the larger and thus more polymorphic population tend towards
higher mutational robustness. Proteins from the larger population also evolve
greater stability, a biophysical property that is known to enhance both
mutational robustness and evolvability. The excess mutational robustness and
stability is well described by existing mathematical theories, and can be
quantitatively related to the way that the proteins occupy their neutral
network.
  CONCLUSIONS: Our work is the first experimental demonstration of the general
tendency of evolution to favor mutational robustness and protein stability in
highly polymorphic populations. We suggest that this phenomenon may contribute
to the mutational robustness and evolvability of viruses and bacteria that
exist in large populations.

frequency intervals are regular. For the potential barriers, only non-periodic

"Blind Identification of Distributed Antenna Systems with Multiple
  Carrier Frequency Offsets","  In spatially distributed multiuser antenna systems, the received signal
contains multiple carrier-frequency offsets (CFOs) arising from mismatch
between the oscillators of transmitters and receivers. This results in a
time-varying rotation of the data constellation, which needs to be compensated
at the receiver before symbol recovery. In this paper, a new approach for blind
CFO estimation and symbol recovery is proposed. The received base-band signal
is over-sampled, and its polyphase components are used to formulate a virtual
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) problem. By applying blind MIMO system
estimation techniques, the system response can be estimated and decoupled
versions of the user symbols can be recovered, each one of which contains a
distinct CFO. By applying a decision feedback Phase Lock Loop (PLL), the CFO
can be mitigated and the transmitted symbols can be recovered. The estimated
MIMO system response provides information about the CFOs that can be used to
initialize the PLL, speed up its convergence, and avoid ambiguities usually
linked with PLL.

Therefore, the proposed algorithm aims to provide an effective and efficient solution for DAS identification in such scenarios.

The authors evaluated the proposed algorithm using computer simulations and compared it with existing methods. The results showed that the proposed algorithm achieved better performance in terms of accuracy and computational complexity. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can handle multiple CFOs, which is a significant advantage over existing methods.

In conclusion, the paper proposes a novel algorithm for blind identification of DAS systems with multiple CFOs. The algorithm's effectiveness and efficiency were demonstrated through computer simulations, indicating that it could be a valuable tool for wireless communication systems' optimal performance.",2007-07-13,True
"Second-order perturbations of cosmological fluids: Relativistic effects

rapid precession and a subsequent spin-flip of the main black hole. This
already occurs in the inspiral phase, therefore can be described analytically
by post-Newtonian techniques. We then identify the radio galaxies with a

Dissipative dynamics of superfluid vortices at non-zero temperatures,"  We consider the evolution and dissipation of vortex rings in a condensate at
non-zero temperature, in the context of the classical field approximation,
based on the defocusing nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation. The temperature in
such a system is fully determined by the total number density and the number
density of the condensate. A vortex ring is introduced into a condensate in a
state of thermal equilibrium, and interacts with non-condensed particles. These
interactions lead to a gradual decrease in the vortex line density, until the
vortex ring completely disappears. We show that the square of the vortex line
length changes linearly with time, and obtain the corresponding universal decay
law. We relate this to mutual friction coefficients in the fundamental equation
of vortex motion in superfluids.

Information-Based Asset Pricing,"  A new framework for asset price dynamics is introduced in which the concept
of noisy information about future cash flows is used to derive the price
processes. In this framework an asset is defined by its cash-flow structure.
Each cash flow is modelled by a random variable that can be expressed as a
function of a collection of independent random variables called market factors.
With each such ""X-factor"" we associate a market information process, the values
of which are accessible to market agents. Each information process is a sum of
two terms; one contains true information about the value of the market factor;
the other represents ""noise"". The noise term is modelled by an independent
Brownian bridge. The market filtration is assumed to be that generated by the
aggregate of the independent information processes. The price of an asset is
given by the expectation of the discounted cash flows in the risk-neutral
measure, conditional on the information provided by the market filtration. When
the cash flows are the dividend payments associated with equities, an explicit
model is obtained for the share-price, and the prices of options on
dividend-paying assets are derived. Remarkably, the resulting formula for the
price of a European call option is of the Black-Scholes-Merton type. The
information-based framework also generates a natural explanation for the origin

"Scaling laws of strategic behaviour and size heterogeneity in agent

A study of structural properties on profiles HMMs,"  Motivation: Profile hidden Markov Models (pHMMs) are a popular and very
useful tool in the detection of the remote homologue protein families.
Unfortunately, their performance is not always satisfactory when proteins are

Each pHMM is constructed by weighting each residue in an aligned protein

HMMER-STRUCT then prioritizes the results by voting. Results: We used the SCOP

performance through ROC curves and through Precision/Recall curves, and assess
significance through the paired two tailed t-test. Our results show significant

Enhanced Half-Metallicity in Edge-Oxidized Zigzag Graphene Nanoribbons,"  We present a novel comprehensive first-principles theoretical study of the
electronic properties and relative stabilities of edge-oxidized zigzag graphene
nanoribbons. The oxidation schemes considered include hydroxyl, carboxyl,
ether, and ketone groups. Using screened exchange density functional theory, we
show that these oxidized ribbons are more stable than hydrogen-terminated
nanoribbons except for the case of the etheric groups. The stable oxidized
configurations maintain a spin-polarized ground state with antiferromagnetic
ordering localized at the edges, similar to the fully hydrogenated
counterparts. More important, edge oxidation is found to lower the onset
electric field required to induce half-metallic behavior and extend the overall
field range at which the systems remain half-metallic. Once the half-metallic
state is reached, further increase of the external electric field intensity
produces a rapid decrease in the spin magnetization up to a point where the
magnetization is quenched completely. Finally, we find that oxygen containing

The Sensitivity of Hybrid Differential Stereoscopy for Spectral Imaging,"  Stereoscopic spectral imaging is an observing technique that affords rapid
acquisition of limited spectral information over an entire image plane

orders, which are imaged separately, and two or more of the dispersed images
are combined using an analogy between the (x,y,\lambda) spectral data space and
conventional (x,y,z) three-space. Because no photons are deliberately destroyed
during image acquisition, the technique is much more photon-efficient in some
observing regimes than existing techniques such as scanned-filtergraph or
scanned-slit spectral imaging. Hybrid differential stereoscopy, which uses a
combination of conventional cross-correlation stereoscopy and linear

transitions of para-ammonia (NH3) and 24 GHz continuum, taken with the
Australia Telescope Compact Array toward 21 southern Galactic hot molecular
cores traced by 6.7 GHz methanol maser emission. We detect NH3(1,1) emission
toward all 21 regions and 24 GHz continuum emission toward 12 of the regions,
including 6 with no reported 8 GHz continuum counterparts. In total, we find
the 21 regions contain 41 NH3(1,1) cores. We extract characteristic spectra for
every core at each of the NH3 transitions and present both integrated intensity
maps and channel maps for each region. The NH3(4,4)+(5,5) emission is always
unresolved and found at the maser position indicating that the methanol masers
are found at the warmest part of the core. We observe large asymmetries in the
NH3(1,1) hyperfine line profiles and conclude this is due to a number of dense,
small clumps within the beam. We derive properties of the ionised gas and find
the 24 GHz continuum sources not detected at 8 GHz are always coincident with
both NH3 and methanol masers in contrast to those detected at 8 + 24 GHz which
are generally offset from the methanol masers. We investigate the possibility
that the former may be hyper-compact HII regions. Finally, we separate the
cores into five groups, based on their association with NH3, methanol maser and
continuum emission. From the different physical properties of the cores in the
groups, we discuss the possibility that these groups may represent cores at
different evolutionary stages of the massive star formation process.

"Multi-wavelength observations of Southern Hot Molecular Cores traced by
  methanol masers - I. Ammonia and 24 GHz Continuum Data","This research paper presents multi-wavelength observations of Southern Hot Molecular Cores (HMCs) using ammonia and 24 GHz continuum data, with a focus on the methanol masers that trace these HMCs. The study found that the ammonia emission is coincident with the methanol masers, indicating that ammonia can be used as a reliable tracer of HMCs. The continuum emission at 24 GHz was also detected in the HMCs, which suggests that the continuum emission can be used to identify HMCs in future surveys. Overall, this study provides important insights into the properties and characteristics of HMCs in the Southern hemisphere.",2008-12-18,True
"Effects of Measurement back-action in the stabilization of a
  Bose-Einstein condensate through feedback","  We apply quantum filtering and control to a particle in a harmonic trap under
continuous position measurement, and show that a simple static feedback law can
be used to cool the system. The final steady state is Gaussian and dependent on
the feedback strength and coupling between the system and probe. In the limit
of weak coupling this final state becomes the ground state. An earlier model by
Haine et. al. (PRA 69, 2004) without measurement back-action showed dark
states: states that did not display error signals, thus remaining unaffected by
the control. This paper shows that for a realistic measurement process this is
not true, which indicates that a Bose-Einstein condensate may be driven towards
the ground state from any arbitrary initial state.

"Effects of Measurement back-action in the stabilization of a
  Bose-Einstein condensate through feedback","This research paper investigates the effects of measurement back-action in the stabilization of a Bose-Einstein condensate through feedback. The behavior of a Bose-Einstein condensate is highly dependent on its environment, making it challenging to stabilize and control. Feedback control is a common technique used to stabilize such systems, but it introduces measurement back-action, which can alter the system's behavior. In this study, we analyze the impact of measurement back-action on the feedback stabilization of a Bose-Einstein condensate. We develop a model that incorporates both the feedback control and measurement back-action and use it to examine the system's stability and performance. Our findings demonstrate that measurement back-action can significantly affect the system's stability and performance, and we provide insights into the limitations and trade-offs associated with feedback control of Bose-Einstein condensates.",2009-11-13,True
"Entanglement and interference between different degrees of freedom of
  photons states","  In this paper, photonic entanglement and interference are described and
analyzed with the language of quantum information process. Correspondingly, a
photon state involving several degrees of freedom is represented in a new
expression based on the permutation symmetry of bosons. In this expression,
each degree of freedom of a single photon is regarded as a qubit and operations
on photons as qubit gates. The two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference is well
interpreted with it. Moreover, the analysis reveals the entanglement between
different degrees of freedom in a four-photon state from parametric down
conversion, even if there is no entanglement between them in the two-photon
state. The entanglement will decrease the state purity and photon interference
visibility in the experiments on a four-photon polarization state.

Poincare Duality Pairs in Dimension Three,"  We extend Hendriks' classification theorem and Turaev's realisation and
splitting theorems for Poincare duality complexes in dimension three to the
relative case of Poincare duality pairs. The results for Poincare duality
complexes are recovered by restricting the results to the case of Poincare
duality pairs with empty boundary. Up to oriented homotopy equivalence,
three-dimensional Poincare duality pairs are classified by their fundamental
triple consisting of the fundamental group system, the orientation character
and the image of the fundamental class under the classifying map. Using the
derived module category we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a
given triple to be realised by a three-dimensional Poincare duality pair. The
results on classification and realisation yield splitting or decomposition
theorems for three-dimensional Poincare duality pairs, that is, conditions
under which a given three-dimensional Poincare duality pair decomposes as
interior or boundary connected sum of two three-dimensional Poincare duality
pairs.

Poincare Duality Pairs in Dimension Three,"The research paper titled ""Poincare Duality Pairs in Dimension Three"" explores the concept of Poincare duality pairs in three-dimensional manifolds. The main objective of the study is to investigate the relationship between the topology and geometry of a three-dimensional manifold and the existence of Poincare duality pairs.

The paper presents several significant discoveries and conclusions. One of the main findings is that the existence of a Poincare duality pair in a three-dimensional manifold is closely related to the topology of the manifold. Specifically, the paper shows that a three-dimensional manifold with a non-trivial fundamental group cannot admit a Poincare duality pair.

Another important result of the study is the characterization of Poincare duality pairs in three-dimensional manifolds. The paper shows that a three-dimensional manifold admits a Poincare duality pair if and only if it is a closed, orientable, and irreducible manifold with a non-empty boundary.

Overall, the research paper provides valuable insights into the concept of Poincare duality pairs in three-dimensional manifolds and sheds light on the relationship between topology and geometry in these manifolds. The findings of the study have important implications for the study of three-dimensional manifolds and their properties.",2007-05-23,True
"Universal temperature scaling of flux line pinning in high-temperature
  superconducting thin films","  Dissipation-free current transport in high-temperature superconductors is one
of the most crucial properties of this class of materials which is directly
related to the effective inhibition of flux line movement by defect structures.
In this respect epitaxially grown thin films of YBa2Cu3O7-d (YBCO) are proving
to be the strongest candidates for many widescale applications that are close
to realization. We show that the relation between different defect structures
and flux line pinning in these films exhibits universal features which are
clearly displayed in a detailed analysis of the temperature-dependent behaviour
of local critical currents. This allows us to identify different pinning
mechanisms at different temperatures to be responsible for the found critical
currents. Additionally, the presence of grain boundaries with very low
misorientation angles affects the temperature stability of the critical
currents which has important consequences for future applications.

  superconducting thin films","This research paper focuses on the study of flux line pinning in high-temperature superconducting thin films. The main objective of the study is to investigate the universal temperature scaling behavior of flux line pinning in these films. The researchers have conducted various experiments to analyze the behavior of flux line pinning as a function of temperature. The crucial finding of the study is that the flux line pinning force scales with the temperature according to a universal power law. This behavior has been observed in various high-temperature superconducting thin films, and the researchers have concluded that it could be a general feature of these materials. These findings could have significant implications for the development of high-temperature superconducting devices and applications.",2009-11-13,True
"Universal spectrum for DNA base CG frequency distribution in Takifugu
  rubripes (Puffer fish) genome","  The frequency distribution of DNA bases A, C, G, T exhibit fractal
fluctuations ubiquitous to dynamical systems in nature. The power spectra of
fractal fluctuations exhibit inverse power law form signifying long-range
correlations between local (small-scale) and global (large-scale)
perturbations. The author has developed a general systems theory based on
classical statistical physics for fractal fluctuations which predicts that the
probability distribution of eddy amplitudes and the variance (square of eddy
amplitude)spectrum of fractal fluctuations follow the universal Boltzmann
inverse power law expressed as a function of the golden mean. The model
predicted distribution is very close to statistical normal distribution for
fluctuations within two standard deviations from the mean and exhibits a fat
long tail. In this paper it is shown that DNA base CG frequency distribution in
Takifugu rubripes (Puffer fish) Genome Release 4 exhibit universal inverse
power law form consistent with model prediction. The observed long-range
correlations in the DNA bases implies that the non-coding 'junk' or 'selfish'
DNA which appear to be redundant, may also contribute to the efficient
functioning of the protein coding DNA, a result supported by recent studies.

The study employs a universal scaling analysis to investigate the genomic distribution of CG base pairs. The findings reveal that the CG frequency distribution follows a universal power-law distribution with an exponent of -1.7, which is consistent across different scales and chromosomes. This suggests that there is a fundamental organizational principle underlying the genomic distribution of CG base pairs in Takifugu rubripes.

Effect of non-linear interface kinetics on coarsening phenomena,"  Coarsening kinetics is usually described using a linear gradient
approximation for the underlying interface migration (IM) rates, wherein the
migration fluxes at the interfaces vary linearly with the driving force. Recent
experimental studies have shown that coarsening of nanocrystalline interface
microstructures is unexpectedly stable compared to conventional parabolic
coarsening kinetics. Here, we show that during early stage coarsening of these
microstructures, IM rates can develop a non-linear dependence on the driving
force, the mean interface curvature. We derive the modified mean field law for
coarsening kinetics. Molecular dynamics simulations of individual grain
boundaries reveal a sub-linear curvature dependence of IM rates, suggesting an
intrinsic origin for the slow coarsening kinetics observed in polycrystalline
metals.

Effect of non-linear interface kinetics on coarsening phenomena,"This research paper investigates the effect of non-linear interface kinetics on coarsening phenomena. Using computational simulations, we demonstrate that non-linear kinetics can significantly alter the coarsening process, leading to the formation of complex morphologies and slower coarsening rates. These findings have important implications for understanding and controlling coarsening in materials science and engineering. Our results suggest that non-linear kinetics should be taken into account when designing materials with desired microstructures and properties.",2007-05-23,True
"Near-IR Spectra of Red Supergiants and Giants. I- Models with Solar and
  with Mixing-Induced Surface Abundance Ratios","  We provide a grid of PHOENIX spectra of red giant and supergiant stars, that
extend through optical and near-IR wavelengths. For the first time, models are
also provided with modified surface abundances of C, N and O, as a step towards
accounting for the changes known to occur due to convective dredge-up (and to
be enhanced in the case of rotation). The aims are (i) to assess how well
current models reproduce observed spectra, (ii) to quantify the effects of the
abundance changes on the spectra, and (iii) to determine how these changes
affect estimates of fundamental stellar parameters.
  Observed giant star spectra can be fitted very well at solar metallicity down
to about 3400K. Modified surface abundances are preferred in only a minority of
cases for luminosity class II, possibly indicating mixing in excess of standard
first dredge-up.
  Supergiant stars show a larger variety of near-IR spectra, and good fits are
currently obtained for about one third of the observations only. Modified
surface abundances help reproducing strong CN bands, but do not suffice to
resolve all the difficulties. The effect of the abundance changes on the
estimated Teff depends on the wavelength range of observation and can amount
several 100K. Reasons for the remaining discrepancies are discussed.
