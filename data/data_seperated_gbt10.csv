The Design of Efficiently-Encodable Rate-Compatible LDPC Codes,"  We present a new class of irregular low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes for
moderate block lengths (up to a few thousand bits) that are well-suited for
rate-compatible puncturing. The proposed codes show good performance under
puncturing over a wide range of rates and are suitable for usage in incremental
redundancy hybrid-automatic repeat request (ARQ) systems. In addition, these
codes are linear-time encodable with simple shift-register circuits. For a
block length of 1200 bits the codes outperform optimized irregular LDPC codes
and extended irregular repeat-accumulate (eIRA) codes for all puncturing rates
0.6~0.9 (base code performance is almost the same) and are particularly good at
high puncturing rates where good puncturing performance has been previously
difficult to achieve.

"The Solar-Interior Equation of State with the Path-Integral Formalism I.
  Domain of Validity","  This is the first paper in a series that deals with solar-physics
applications of the equation-of-state formalism based on the formulation of the
so-called ""Feynman-Kac (FK) representation"". Here, the FK equation of state is
presented and adapted for solar applications. Its domain of validity is
assessed. The practical application to the Sun will be dealt with in Paper II.
Paper III will extend the current FK formalism to a higher order. Use of the FK
equation of state is limited to physical conditions for which more than 90% of
helium is ionized. This incudes the inner region of the Sun out to about .98 of
the solar radius. Despite this limitation, in the parts of the Sun where it is
applicable, the FK equation of state has the power to be more accurate than the
equations of state currently used in solar modeling. The FK approach is
especially suited to study physical effects such as Coulomb screening, bound
states, the onset of recombination of fully ionized species, as well as
diffraction and exchange effects. The localizing power of helioseismology
allows a test of the FK equation of state. Such a test will be beneficial both
for better solar models and for tighter solar constraints of the equation of
state.

Modified Brans-Dicke theory of gravity from five-dimensional vacuum,"  We investigate, in the context of five-dimensional (5D) Brans-Dicke theory of

Free zero-range processes on networks,"  A free zero-range process (FRZP) is a simple stochastic process describing
the dynamics of a gas of particles hopping between neighboring nodes of a
network. We discuss three different cases of increasing complexity: (a) FZRP on
a rigid geometry where the network is fixed during the process, (b) FZRP on a
random graph chosen from a given ensemble of networks, (c) FZRP on a dynamical
network whose topology continuously changes during the process in a way which
depends on the current distribution of particles. The case (a) provides a very
simple realization of the phenomenon of condensation which manifests as the
appearance of a condensate of particles on the node with maximal degree. The
case (b) is very interesting since the averaging over typical ensembles of
graphs acts as a kind of homogenization of the system which makes all nodes
identical from the point of view of the FZRP. In the case (c), the distribution
of particles and the dynamics of network are coupled to each other. The
strength of this coupling depends on the ratio of two time scales: for changes
of the topology and of the FZRP. We will discuss a specific example of that
type of interaction and show that it leads to an interesting phase diagram.

"Tail universalities in rank distributions as an algebraic problem: the
  beta-like function","  Although power laws of the Zipf type have been used by many workers to fit
rank distributions in different fields like in economy, geophysics, genetics,
soft-matter, networks etc., these fits usually fail at the tails. Some
distributions have been proposed to solve the problem, but unfortunately they
do not fit at the same time both ending tails. We show that many different data
in rank laws, like in granular materials, codons, author impact in scientific
journal, etc. are very well fitted by a beta-like function. Then we propose
that such universality is due to the fact that a system made from many
subsystems or choices, imply stretched exponential frequency-rank functions
which qualitatively and quantitatively can be fitted with the proposed
beta-like function distribution in the limit of many random variables. We prove
this by transforming the problem into an algebraic one: finding the rank of
successive products of a given set of numbers.

Time-Reversal Coherent Control in Nanoplasmonics,"  We introduce an approach to determining the required waveforms to coherently

"Ballistic Graphene Nanoribbon MOSFETs: a full quantum real-space
  simulation study","  A real-space quantum transport simulator for carbon nanoribbon (CNR) MOSFETs
has been developed. Using this simulator, the performance of carbon nanoribbon
(CNR) MOSFETs is examined in the ballistic limit. The impact of quantum effects
on device performance of CNR MOSFETs is also studied. We found that 2D
semi-infinite graphene contacts provide metal-induced-gap-states (MIGS) in the
CNR channel. These states would provide quantum tunneling in the short channel
device and cause Fermi level pining. These effects cause device performance
degradation both on the ON-state and the OFF-state. Pure 1D devices (infinite
contacts), however, show no MIGS. Quantum tunneling effects are still playing
an important role in the device characteristics. Conduction due to band-to-band
tunneling is accurately captured in our simulations. It is important in these
devices, and found to dominate the off-state current. Based on our simulations,
both a 1.4nm wide and a 1.8nm wide CNR with channel length of 12.5nm can
outperform ultra scaled Si devices in terms of drive current capabilities and
electrostatic control. Although subthreshold slopes in the forward-bias
conduction are better than in Si transistors, tunneling currents are important

"Continuum and all-atom description of the energetics of graphene

different regimes of cone sizes in which cones with a particular number of
disclinations are preferred energywise. An important result of the study is

Clustering Co-occurrence of Maximal Frequent Patterns in Streams,"  One way of getting a better view of data is using frequent patterns. In this
paper frequent patterns are subsets that occur a minimal number of times in a
stream of itemsets. However, the discovery of frequent patterns in streams has
always been problematic. Because streams are potentially endless it is in
principle impossible to say if a pattern is often occurring or not. Furthermore
the number of patterns can be huge and a good overview of the structure of the
stream is lost quickly. The proposed approach will use clustering to facilitate
the analysis of the structure of the stream.
  A clustering on the co-occurrence of patterns will give the user an improved
view on the structure of the stream. Some patterns might occur so much together
that they should form a combined pattern. In this way the patterns in the
clustering will be the largest frequent patterns: maximal frequent patterns.
  Our approach to decide if patterns occur often together will be based on a
method of clustering when only the distance between pairs is known. The number
of maximal frequent patterns is much smaller and combined with clustering
methods these patterns provide a good view on the structure of the stream.

Physically Sound Hamiltonian Formulation of the Dynamical Casimir Effect,"  Recently [J. Haro and E. Elizalde, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 97}, 130401 (2006)],
a Hamiltonian formulation has been introduced in order to address some
longstanding severe problems associated with the physical description of the
dynamical Casimir effect at all times while the mirrors are moving. Here we

derived in our approach contains a reactive term --proportional to the mirrors'
acceleration. This is of the essence in order to obtain particles with a
positive energy all the time during the oscillation of the mirrors --while
always satisfying the energy conservation law. A careful analysis of the
interrelations among the different results previously obtained in the
literature is then carried out. For simplicity, the specific case of a neutral
scalar field in one dimension, with one or two partially transmitting mirrors

"Quasi Ordinary Singularities, Essential Divisors and Poincare Series","  We define Poincar\'e series associated to a toric or analytically irreducible
quasi-ordinary hypersurface singularity, (S,0), by a finite sequence of

Poincar\'e series associated to the set of divisorial valuations associated to
the essential divisors, considered both over the singular locus and over the
point 0, is an analytic invariant of the singularity. In the quasi-ordinary
hypersurface case we prove that this Poincar\'e series determines and it is

Spectral method for matching exterior and interior elliptic problems,"  A spectral method is described for solving coupled elliptic problems on an
interior and an exterior domain. The method is formulated and tested on the
two-dimensional interior Poisson and exterior Laplace problems, whose solutions
and their normal derivatives are required to be continuous across the
interface. A complete basis of homogeneous solutions for the interior and
exterior regions, corresponding to all possible Dirichlet boundary values at
the interface, are calculated in a preprocessing step. This basis is used to
construct the influence matrix which serves to transform the coupled boundary
conditions into conditions on the interior problem. Chebyshev approximations
are used to represent both the interior solutions and the boundary values. A
standard Chebyshev spectral method is used to calculate the interior solutions.
The exterior harmonic solutions are calculated as the convolution of the
free-space Green's function with a surface density; this surface density is
itself the solution to an integral equation which has an analytic solution when
the boundary values are given as a Chebyshev expansion. Properties of Chebyshev
approximations insure that the basis of exterior harmonic functions represents
the external near-boundary solutions uniformly. The method is tested by
calculating the electrostatic potential resulting from charge distributions in
a rectangle. The resulting influence matrix is well-conditioned and solutions
converge exponentially as the resolution is increased. The generalization of

"Nanostructure and velocity of field-driven solid-on-solid interfaces
  moving under a phonon-assisted dynamic","  The nanoscopic structure and the stationary propagation velocity of
(1+1)-dimensional solid-on-solid interfaces in an Ising lattice-gas model,
which are driven far from equilibrium by an applied force, such as a magnetic
field or a difference in (electro)chemical potential, are studied by an
analytic nonlinear-response approximation together with kinetic Monte Carlo
simulations. Here we consider the case that the system is coupled to a
two-dimensional phonon bath. In the resulting dynamic, transitions that
conserve the system energy are forbidden, and the effects of the applied force
and the interaction energies do not factorize (a so-called hard dynamic). In
full agreement with previous general theoretical results we find that the local
interface width changes dramatically with the applied force. However, in
contrast with other hard dynamics, this change is nonmonotonic in the driving
force. However, significant differences between theory and simulation are found
near two special values of the driving force, where certain transitions allowed
by the solid-on-solid model become forbidden by the phonon-assisted dynamic.
Our results represent a significant step toward providing a solid physical

Validating module network learning algorithms using simulated data,"  In recent years, several authors have used probabilistic graphical models to
learn expression modules and their regulatory programs from gene expression
data. Here, we demonstrate the use of the synthetic data generator SynTReN for
the purpose of testing and comparing module network learning algorithms. We
introduce a software package for learning module networks, called LeMoNe, which
incorporates a novel strategy for learning regulatory programs. Novelties
include the use of a bottom-up Bayesian hierarchical clustering to construct
the regulatory programs, and the use of a conditional entropy measure to assign
regulators to the regulation program nodes. Using SynTReN data, we test the
performance of LeMoNe in a completely controlled situation and assess the
effect of the methodological changes we made with respect to an existing
software package, namely Genomica. Additionally, we assess the effect of
various parameters, such as the size of the data set and the amount of noise,
on the inference performance. Overall, application of Genomica and LeMoNe to
simulated data sets gave comparable results. However, LeMoNe offers some
advantages, one of them being that the learning process is considerably faster
for larger data sets. Additionally, we show that the location of the regulators
in the LeMoNe regulation programs and their conditional entropy may be used to
prioritize regulators for functional validation, and that the combination of
the bottom-up clustering strategy with the conditional entropy-based assignment

Dynamic Properties of Molecular Motors in Burnt-Bridge Models,"  Dynamic properties of molecular motors that fuel their motion by actively
interacting with underlying molecular tracks are studied theoretically via
discrete-state stochastic ``burnt-bridge'' models. The transport of the
particles is viewed as an effective diffusion along one-dimensional lattices
with periodically distributed weak links. When an unbiased random walker passes
the weak link it can be destroyed (``burned'') with probability p, providing a
bias in the motion of the molecular motor. A new theoretical approach that
allows one to calculate exactly all dynamic properties of motor proteins, such
as velocity and dispersion, at general conditions is presented. It is found
that dispersion is a decreasing function of the concentration of bridges, while
the dependence of dispersion on the burning probability is more complex. Our
calculations also show a gap in dispersion for very low concentrations of weak
links which indicates a dynamic phase transition between unbiased and biased
diffusion regimes. Theoretical findings are supported by Monte Carlo computer
simulations.

Learning to Bluff,"  The act of bluffing confounds game designers to this day. The very nature of
bluffing is even open for debate, adding further complication to the process of
creating intelligent virtual players that can bluff, and hence play,
realistically. Through the use of intelligent, learning agents, and carefully
designed agent outlooks, an agent can in fact learn to predict its opponents
reactions based not only on its own cards, but on the actions of those around
it. With this wider scope of understanding, an agent can in learn to bluff its
opponents, with the action representing not an illogical action, as bluffing is
often viewed, but rather as an act of maximising returns through an effective
statistical optimisation. By using a tee dee lambda learning algorithm to
continuously adapt neural network agent intelligence, agents have been shown to
be able to learn to bluff without outside prompting, and even to learn to call
each others bluffs in free, competitive play.

Light Curve Calculations of Supernovae from Fallback Gamma-Ray Bursts,"  The currently-favored model for long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) invokes

black-hole GRBs have been recently been argued as possible progenitors of a
newly discovered set of GRBs lacking any associated supernovae. Here we present
the first ever radiation-hydrodynamics calculations of the light-curves

The ontology of temperature in nonequilibrium systems,"  The laws of thermodynamics provide a clear concept of the temperature for an
equilibrium system in the continuum limit. Meanwhile, the equipartition theorem
allows one to make a connection between the ensemble average of the kinetic
energy and the uniform temperature. When a system or its environment is far
from equilibrium, however, such an association does not necessarily apply. In
small systems, the regression hypothesis may not even apply. Herein, we show
that in small nonequilibrium systems, the regression hypothesis still holds
though with a generalized definition of the temperature. The latter must now be
defined for each such manifestation.

The results show that temperature in nonequilibrium systems is a complex and multifaceted concept that cannot be reduced to a single measure. Instead, temperature must be understood in the context of the system's dynamics, with different measures of temperature depending on the specific properties of the system under consideration. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for the study of nonequilibrium systems and for the broader understanding of temperature in physics.",2009-11-13,True

  contributions","The research paper titled ""The Higgs sector of the complex MSSM at two-loop order: QCD contributions"" investigates the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) contributions to the Higgs sector of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The central theme of the paper is to determine the impact of QCD corrections on the Higgs sector, particularly at the two-loop level.

The authors used a combination of analytical and numerical methods to calculate the two-loop QCD corrections to the Higgs boson mass and decay rates in the complex MSSM. They found that the QCD corrections play a significant role in the Higgs sector, affecting the masses and decay rates of the Higgs bosons. In particular, they found that the QCD corrections can increase the mass of the lightest Higgs boson by up to 10 GeV, which has important implications for experimental searches for the Higgs boson.

The authors also investigated the impact of the QCD corrections on the decays of the Higgs bosons into bottom quarks and tau leptons. They found that the QCD corrections can increase the branching ratio of the lightest Higgs boson into bottom quarks by up to 20%, while decreasing the branching ratio into tau leptons by up to 10%. These findings have important implications for the interpretation of experimental data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and future colliders.

Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the QCD corrections to the Higgs sector of the complex MSSM at the two-loop level, and highlights the importance of including these corrections in theoretical predictions for the Higgs sector.",2008-11-26,True
Damped Corrections to Inflationary Spectra from a Fluctuating Cutoff,"  We reconsider trans-Planckian corrections to inflationary spectra by taking
into account a physical effect which has been overlooked and which could have
important consequences. We assume that the short length scale characterizing
the new physics is endowed with a finite width, the origin of which could be
found in quantum gravity. As a result, the leading corrections responsible for
superimposed osillations in the CMB temperature anisotropies are generically
damped by the blurring of the UV scale. To determine the observational
ramifications of this damping, we compare it to that which effectively occurs
when computing the angular power spectrum of temperature anisotropies. The
former gives an overall change of the oscillation amplitudes whereas the latter
depends on the angular scale. Therefore, in principle they could be
distinguished. In any case, the observation of superimposed oscillations would
place tight constraint on the variance of the UV cutoff.

Our analysis shows that the fluctuations in the cutoff can indeed lead to damped corrections to the spectra, which could have important implications for the interpretation of cosmological observations.

Our results suggest that a better understanding of the cutoff fluctuations could help improve our ability to extract information about the early universe from observational data.",2008-11-26,True
"Ratios of star cluster core and half-mass radii: a cautionary note on
  intermediate-mass black holes in star clusters","  There is currently much interest in the possible presence of
intermediate-mass black holes in the cores of globular clusters. Based on
theoretical arguments and simulation results it has previously been suggested
that a large core radius -- or particularly a large ratio of the core radius to
half-mass radius -- is a promising indicator for finding such a black hole in a
star cluster. In this study N-body models of 100000 stars with and without
primordial binaries are used to investigate the long-term structural evolution
of star clusters. Importantly, the simulation data is analysed using the same
processes by which structural parameters are extracted from observed star
clusters. This gives a ratio of the core and half-mass (or half-light) radii
that is directly comparable to the Galactic globular cluster sample. As a
result, it is shown that the ratios observed for the bulk of this sample can be
explained without the need for an intermediate-mass black hole. Furthermore, it
is possible that clusters with large core to half-light radius ratios harbour a
black-hole binary (comprised of stellar mass black holes) rather than a single
massive black hole. This work does not rule out the existence of
intermediate-mass black holes in the cores of at least some star clusters.

Hamiltonians containing straight-line librating orbits, the transcritical
bifurcation of these orbits is the typical case which occurs also in the
absence of any discrete symmetries, while their isochronous pitchfork
bifurcation is an exception. We determine the normal forms of both types of
bifurcations and derive the uniform approximation required to include
transcritically bifurcating orbits in the semiclassical trace formula for the

Stallings' Foldings and Subgroups of Amalgams of Finite Groups,"  In the 1980's Stallings showed that every finitely generated subgroup of a

automata and finite inverse monoids to be used to answer questions about
finitely generated subgroups of free groups.
  In this paper we attempt to apply the same methods to other classes of
groups. A fundamental new problem is that the Stallings folding algorithm must
be modified to allow for ``sewing'' on relations of non-free groups. We look at
the class of groups that are amalgams of finite groups. It is known that these

"Equivalence of LP Relaxation and Max-Product for Weighted Matching in
  General Graphs","  Max-product belief propagation is a local, iterative algorithm to find the
mode/MAP estimate of a probability distribution. While it has been successfully
employed in a wide variety of applications, there are relatively few
theoretical guarantees of convergence and correctness for general loopy graphs
that may have many short cycles. Of these, even fewer provide exact ``necessary
and sufficient'' characterizations.
  In this paper we investigate the problem of using max-product to find the
maximum weight matching in an arbitrary graph with edge weights. This is done
by first constructing a probability distribution whose mode corresponds to the
optimal matching, and then running max-product. Weighted matching can also be
posed as an integer program, for which there is an LP relaxation. This
relaxation is not always tight. In this paper we show that \begin{enumerate}
\item If the LP relaxation is tight, then max-product always converges, and
that too to the correct answer. \item If the LP relaxation is loose, then
max-product does not converge. \end{enumerate} This provides an exact,
data-dependent characterization of max-product performance, and a precise
connection to LP relaxation, which is a well-studied optimization technique.
Also, since LP relaxation is known to be tight for bipartite graphs, our
results generalize other recent results on using max-product to find weighted
matchings in bipartite graphs.

"Symmetries in Differential Geometry: A Computational Approach to
  Prolongations","  The aim of this work is to develop a systematic manner to close
overdetermined systems arising from conformal Killing tensors (CKT). The
research performs this action for 1-tensor and 2-tensors. This research makes
it possible to develop a new general method for any rank of CKT. This method
can also be applied to other types of Killing equations, as well as to
overdetermined systems constrained by some other conditions.
  The major methodological apparatus of the research is a decomposition of the
section bundles where the covariant derivatives of the CKT land via generalized
gradients. This decomposition generates a tree in which each row represents a
higher derivative. After using the conformal Killing equation, just a few
components (branches) survive, which means that most of them can be expressed
in terms of lower order terms. This results in a finite number of independent
jets. Thus, any higher covariant derivative can be written in terms of these
jets.

specifically, in the potential for the discovery of symmetries. First, this
work has uncovered a new method that could be used to close overdetermined
systems arising from conformal Killing tensors (CKT). Second, through an
application of this method, this research finds higher symmetry operators of

Generalized Landauer Buettiker Equations, a simplified integral form of the

Stability of Polytropes,"  This paper is an investigation of the stability of some ideal stars. It is

conditions should be and we are consequently skeptical of the concept of a
fixed boundary. In this paper we investigate the double polytrope,
characterized by a polytropic index n less than 5 in the bulk of the star and a
value larger than 5 in an outer atmosphere that extends to infinity. It has no
fixed boundary but a region of critical density where the polytropic index
changes from a value that is appropriate for the bulk of the star to a value
that provides a crude model for the atmosphere. The existence of a relation

Ageing memory and glassiness of a driven vortex system,"  Many systems in nature, glasses, interfaces and fractures being some
examples, cannot equilibrate with their environment, which gives rise to novel

Unlike their equilibrated counterparts, the dynamics of out-of- equilibrium
systems is generally too complex to be captured by simple macroscopic laws.
Here we investigate a system that straddles the boundary between glass and
crystal: a Bragg glass formed by vortices in a superconductor. We find that the
response to an applied force evolves according to a stretched exponential, with
the exponent reflecting the deviation from equilibrium. After the force is
removed, the system ages with time and its subsequent response time scales
linearly with its age (simple ageing), meaning that older systems are slower
than younger ones. We show that simple ageing can occur naturally in the
presence of sufficient quenched disorder. Moreover, the hierarchical
distribution of timescales, arising when chunks of loose vortices cannot move

"Non-cooperative games for spreading code optimization, power control and
  receiver design in wireless data networks","  This paper focuses on the issue of energy efficiency in wireless data
networks through a game theoretic approach. The case considered is that in
which each user is allowed to vary its transmit power, spreading code, and
uplink receiver in order to maximize its own utility, which is here defined as
the ratio of data throughput to transmit power. In particular, the case in
which linear multiuser detectors are employed at the receiver is treated first,
and, then, the more challenging case in which non-linear decision feedback
multiuser receivers are adopted is addressed. It is shown that, for both
receivers, the problem at hand of utility maximization can be regarded as a
non-cooperative game, and it is proved that a unique Nash equilibrium point
exists. Simulation results show that significant performance gains can be
obtained through both non-linear processing and spreading code optimization; in
particular, for systems with a number of users not larger than the processing
gain, remarkable gains come from spreading code optimization, while, for
overloaded systems, the largest gainscome from the use of non-linear
processing. In every case, however, the non-cooperative games proposed here are

Towards a New Standard Model for Black Hole Accretion,"  We briefly review recent developments in black hole accretion disk theory,

of angular momentum transport and allows accretion of matter to proceed at an
interesting rate. Furthermore, we argue that when vertical transport is
important, the radial structure of the accretion disk is modified at small
radii and this affects the disk emission spectrum. We present a simple model
demonstrating how energetic, magnetically-driven outflows modify the emergent
disk emission spectrum with respect to that predicted by standard accretion
disk theory. A comparison of the predicted spectra against observations of

Integrable Systems and Topology of Isospectral Manifolds,"  The well known Liouville-Arnold theorem says that if a level surface of

singular or the symplectic form is singular or degenerate. In such situations
the Liouville-Arnold theorem does not apply. However, sometimes it is possible
to define the corresponding flow on the whole level surface of integrals and
use this flow to investigate the topology. Tomei (1982) and Fried (1986) used

"A Metric for Gradient RG Flow of the Worldsheet Sigma Model Beyond First

gradient generates to all orders in perturbation theory the Renormalization
Group (RG) flow of the target space metric in the worldsheet sigma model. The
gradient is defined with respect to a metric on the space of coupling constants
which is explicitly known only to leading order in perturbation theory, but at
that order is positive semi-definite, as follows from Perelman's work on the
Ricci flow. This gives rise to a monotonicity formula for the flow which is
expected to fail only if the beta function perturbation series fails to
converge, which can happen if curvatures or their derivatives grow large. We
test the validity of the monotonicity formula at next-to-leading order in
perturbation theory by explicitly computing the second-order terms in the
metric on the space of coupling constants. At this order, this metric is found
not to be positive semi-definite. In situations where this might spoil

Demixing and orientational ordering in mixtures of rectangular particles,"  Using scaled-particle theory for binary mixtures of two-dimensional hard
particles with rotational freedom, we analyse the stability of nematic phases
and the demixing phase behaviour of a variety of mixtures, focussing on cases
where at least one of the components consists of hard rectangles or hard

uniaxial nematic phase, an additional (tetratic) oriented phase, possessing two
directors, which is the analogue of the biaxial or cubatic phases in three-
dimensional fluids. There is computer simulation evidence that the tetratic
phase might be stable with respect to phases with spatial order for rectangles

possessing stable tetratic order by themselves, the tetratic phase is
destabilised, via a first- or second-order phase transition, to uniaxial
nematic or isotropic phases; for hard rectangles of low aspect ratio tetratic
order persists in a relatively large range of volume fractions. The order of
these transitions depends on the particle geometry, dimensions and
thermodynamic conditions of the mixture. The second component of the mixture
has been chosen to be hard discs or disco-rectangles, the geometry of which is

subject to decadal variations due to lunar precession. The latter is a key
property of the Moon's apparent orbit around the Earth - the nodes of that
orbit precess around the ecliptic, completing one revolution every 18.6 years.
This precession is responsible for a number of astronomical phenomena, e.g. the
year to year drift of solar and lunar eclipse periods. It also controls the
ecliptic latitude at which the Moon crosses the magnetotail and thus the number
and duration of lunar encounters with the plasmasheet. This paper presents a
detailed model of those encounters and applies it to the period 1960 to 2030.
This shows that the total lunar exposure to the plasmasheet will vary from 10
hours per month at a minimum of the eighteen-year cycle rising to 40 hours per
month at the maximum. These variations could have a profound impact on the
accumulation of charge due plasmasheet electrons impacting the lunar surface.
Thus we should expect the level of lunar surface charging to vary over the
eighteen-year cycle. The literature contains reports that support this: several
observations made during the cycle maximum of 1994-2000 are attributed to
bombardment and charging of the lunar surface by plasmasheet electrons. Thus we
conclude that lunar surface charging will vary markedly over an eighteen-year
cycle driven by lunar precession. It is important to interpret lunar
environment measurements in the context of this cycle and to allow for the
cycle when designing equipment for deployment on the lunar surface. This is
particularly important in respect of developing plans for robotic exploration
on the lunar surface during the next cycle maximum of 2012-19.

Electrostatic Interactions of Asymmetrically Charged Membranes,"  We predict the nature (attractive or repulsive) and range (exponentially
screened or long-range power law) of the electrostatic interactions of
oppositely charged and planar plates as a function of the salt concentration
and surface charge densities (whose absolute magnitudes are not necessarily
equal). An analytical expression for the crossover between attractive and
repulsive pressure is obtained as a function of the salt concentration. This
condition reduces to the high-salt limit of Parsegian and Gingell where the
interaction is exponentially screened and to the zero salt limit of Lau and
Pincus in which the important length scales are the inter-plate separation and
the Gouy-Chapman length. In the regime of low salt and high surface charges we
predict - for any ratio of the charges on the surfaces - that the attractive
pressure is long-ranged as a function of the spacing. The attractive pressure
is related to the decrease in counter-ion concentration as the inter-plate
distance is decreased. Our theory predicts several scaling regimes with
different scaling expressions for the pressure as function of salinity and
surface charge densities. The pressure predictions can be related to surface

"Origin of the early-type R stars: a binary-merger solution to a

  We have synthesized binary star populations to calculate the number of merged

evolutionary channels. The most common of which is the merger of a helium white
dwarf with a hydrogen-burning red giant branch star during a common envelope
phase followed by a helium flash in a rotating core which mixes carbon to the
surface. All the channels together give ten times more early-R stars than we
require to match recent Hipparcos observations - we discuss which channels are
likely to be the true early-R stars and which are not. For the first time we

The role of elastic stresses on leaf venation morphogenesis,"  We explore the possible role of elastic mismatch between epidermis and

transport of the hormone auxin out of the leaves triggers cell differentiation
to form veins. Although there is evidence that auxin plays a fundamental role
in vein formation, the simple canalization mechanism may not be enough to
explain some features observed in the vascular system of leaves, in particular,
the abundance of vein loops. We present a model based on the existence of
mechanical instabilities that leads very naturally to hierarchical patterns
with a large number of closed loops. When applied to the structure of high
order veins, the numerical results show the same qualitative features as actual
venation patterns and, furthermore, have the same statistical properties. We

Game-Theoretic Power Control in Impulse Radio UWB Wireless Networks,"  In this paper, a game-theoretic model for studying power control for wireless

Network Structure of Protein Folding Pathways,"  The classical approach to protein folding inspired by statistical mechanics
avoids the high dimensional structure of the conformation space by using
effective coordinates. Here we introduce a network approach to capture the

elementary rotations around a chemical bond. Self-avoidance of a polypeptide
chain introduces degree correlations in the conformation network, which in turn
lead to energy landscape correlations. Folding can be interpreted as a biased
random walk on the conformation network. We show that the folding pathways
along energy gradients organize themselves into scale free networks, thus
explaining previous observations made via molecular dynamics simulations. We
also show that these energy landscape correlations are essential for recovering
the observed connectivity exponent, which belongs to a different universality
class than that of random energy models. In addition, we predict that the

"Relic abundance of dark matter in universal extra dimension models with
  right-handed neutrinos","  Relic abundance of dark matter is investigated in the framework of universal
extra dimension models with right-handed neutrinos. These models are free from
the serious Kaluza-Klein (KK) graviton problem that the original universal
extra dimension model has. The first KK particle of the right-handed neutrino
is a candidate for dark matter in this framework, and its relic abundance is
determined by three processes, (1) the decay of the KK photon into the first KK
right-handed neutrino in the late universe, (2) production of the first KK
right-handed neutrino from the thermal bath in the early universe, and (3) the
decay of higher KK right-handed neutrinos into the first KK right-handed
neutrino in the late universe. When ordinary neutrino masses are large enough
such as the degenerate mass spectrum case, the last process contribute to the
abundance significantly, even if the reheating temperature is low. The scale of
the extra dimension consistent with cosmological observations can be 500 GeV in
the minimal setup of universal extra dimension models with right-handed
neutrinos.

Stability of spinor Fermi gases in tight waveguides,"  The two and three-body correlation functions of the ground state of an
optically trapped ultracold spin-1/2 Fermi gas (SFG) in a tight waveguide (1D

assuming a 1D attractive zero-range odd-wave interaction induced by a 3D p-wave
Feshbach resonance, as well as the usual repulsive zero-range even-wave
interaction stemming from 3D s-wave scattering. The calculations are based on
the exact mapping from the SFG to a ``Lieb-Liniger-Heisenberg'' model with
delta-function repulsions depending on isotropic Heisenberg spin-spin
interactions, and indicate that the SFG should be stable against three-body
recombination in a large region of the coupling constant plane encompassing
parts of both the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases. However, the
limiting case of the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas (FTG), a spin-aligned 1D

Search for color charge dependence of energy loss at RHIC,"  The non-Abelian feature of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) results in the gluons

Search for color charge dependence of energy loss at RHIC,"The research paper titled ""Search for color charge dependence of energy loss at RHIC"" aimed to investigate the dependence of energy loss on the color charge of quarks and gluons in heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The study utilized data from collisions between gold ions and protons at different energies and impact parameters. The main objective was to test the hypothesis of jet quenching, which predicts that quarks and gluons with larger color charges will lose more energy as they traverse the quark-gluon plasma (QGP).

The study found no evidence of color charge dependence of energy loss in the QGP produced at RHIC. The data were consistent with the hypothesis of jet quenching, indicating that all partons lose energy as they traverse the QGP, regardless of their color charge. The findings provide important insights into the nature of the QGP and the mechanisms of jet quenching, which have important implications for the study of high-energy nuclear collisions.

In conclusion, the study demonstrated that the energy loss in the QGP produced at RHIC does not depend on the color charge of the partons, providing important constraints on theoretical models of jet quenching and the QGP.

A New Three-DOF Parallel Mechanism: Milling Machine Applications,"  This paper describes a new parallel kinematic architecture for machining
applications, namely, the orthoglide. This machine features three fixed

"What Can the Cosmic Microwave Background Tell Us About the Outer Solar

Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to place constraints upon the mass, distance,

We apply this technique to the spectral measurements of the CMB by the Far
Infrared Absolute Spectrophotometer (FIRAS) on the Cosmic Background Explorer

"A new method to derive star formation histories of galaxies from their
  star cluster distributions","  Star formation happens in a clustered way which is why the star cluster
population of a particular galaxy is closely related to the star formation
history of this galaxy. From the probabilistic nature of a mass function
follows that the mass of the most-massive cluster of a complete population,
M_max, has a distribution with the total mass of the population as a parameter.
The total mass of the population is connected to the star formation rate (SFR)
by the length of a formation epoch.
  Since due to evolutionary effects only massive star clusters are observable
up to high ages it is convenient to use this M_max(SFR) relation for the
reconstruction of a star formation history. The age-distribution of the
most-massive clusters can therefore be used to constrain the star formation
history of a galaxy. The method, including an assessment of the inherent
uncertainties, is introduced with this contribution, while following papers
will apply this method to a number of galaxies.

"Decoherence of a driven multilevel quantum system interacting with a

Tracking User Attention in Collaborative Tagging Communities,"  Collaborative tagging has recently attracted the attention of both industry

CiteULike, del.icio.us, and Flickr. These systems give users the opportunity to
add data items and to attach their own metadata (or tags) to stored data. The
result is an effective content management tool for individual users. Recent
studies, however, suggest that, as tagging communities grow, the added content

Thus, mechanisms that cope with increase of diversity are fundamental to

new metrics for similarity in user interest and use these metrics to uncover
the structure of the tagging communities we study. The structure we uncover

"Angles Between Infinite Dimensional Subspaces with Applications to the
  Rayleigh-Ritz and Alternating Projectors Methods","  We define angles from-to and between infinite dimensional subspaces of a
Hilbert space, inspired by the work of E. J. Hannan, 1961/1962 for general
canonical correlations of stochastic processes. The spectral theory of
selfadjoint operators is used to investigate the properties of the angles,
e.g., to establish connections between the angles corresponding to orthogonal
complements. The classical gaps and angles of Dixmier and Friedrichs are
characterized in terms of the angles. We introduce principal invariant
subspaces and prove that they are connected by an isometry that appears in the
polar decomposition of the product of corresponding orthogonal projectors.
Point angles are defined by analogy with the point operator spectrum. We bound
the Hausdorff distance between the sets of the squared cosines of the angles
corresponding to the original subspaces and their perturbations. We show that
the squared cosines of the angles from one subspace to another can be
interpreted as Ritz values in the Rayleigh-Ritz method, where the former
subspace serves as a trial subspace and the orthogonal projector of the latter
subspace serves as an operator in the Rayleigh-Ritz method. The Hausdorff
distance between the Ritz values, corresponding to different trial subspaces,
is shown to be bounded by a constant times the gap between the trial subspaces.
We prove a similar eigenvalue perturbation bound that involves the gap squared.
Finally, we consider the classical alternating projectors method and propose
its ultimate acceleration, using the conjugate gradient approach. The

"Fuzzy Artmap and Neural Network Approach to Online Processing of Inputs
  with Missing Values","  An ensemble based approach for dealing with missing data, without predicting
or imputing the missing values is proposed. This technique is suitable for
online operations of neural networks and as a result, is used for online
condition monitoring. The proposed technique is tested in both classification
and regression problems. An ensemble of Fuzzy-ARTMAPs is used for
classification whereas an ensemble of multi-layer perceptrons is used for the
regression problem. Results obtained using this ensemble-based technique are
compared to those obtained using a combination of auto-associative neural
networks and genetic algorithms and findings show that this method can perform
up to 9% better in regression problems. Another advantage of the proposed
technique is that it eliminates the need for finding the best estimate of the
data, and hence, saves time.

"The 2003 Outburst of the X-ray Transient H 1743-322: Comparisons with
  the Black Hole Microquasar XTE J1550-564","  The bright X-ray transient H 1743-322 was observed daily by the Rossi X-ray
Timing Explorer (RXTE) during most of its 8-month outburst in 2003. We present
a detailed spectral analysis and a supporting timing analysis of all of these
data, and we discuss the behavior and evolution of the source in terms of the
three principal X-ray states defined by Remillard and McClintock. These X-ray
results are complemented by Very Large Array (VLA) data obtained at six
frequencies that provide quite complete coverage of the entire outburst cycle
at 4.860 GHz and 8.460 GHz. We also present photometric data and finding charts
for the optical counterpart in both outburst and quiescence. We closely compare
H 1743-322 to the well-studied black-hole X-ray transient XTE J1550-564 and
find the behaviors of these systems to be very similar. As reported elsewhere,
both H 1743-322 and XTE J1550-564 are relativistic jet sources and both exhibit
a pair of high-frequency QPO oscillations with a 3:2 frequency ratio. The many
striking similarities between these two sources argue strongly that H 1743-322
is a black hole binary, although presently no dynamical data exist to support
this conclusion.

The authors analyze the X-ray and radio properties of both objects during their outbursts and find that H 1743-322 had a longer duration and lower peak luminosity than XTE J1550-564.

Strategies for the Design of a Slide-o-Cam Transmission,"  The optimization of the pressure angle in a cam-follower transmission is
reported in this paper. This transmission is based on Slide-o-Cam, a cam
mechanism with multiple rollers mounted on a common translating follower. The
design of Slide-o-Cam, a transmission intended to produce a sliding motion from
a turning drive, or vice versa, was reported elsewhere. This transmission
provides pure-rolling motion, thereby reducing the friction of rack-and-pinions
and linear drives. The pressure angle is a suitable performance index for this
transmission because it determines the amount of force transmitted to the load
vs. that transmitted to the machine frame. Two alternative design strategies
are studied, namely, (i) increase the number of lobes on each cam or (ii)
increase the number of cams. This device is intended to replace the current
ball-screws in Orthoglide, a three-DOF parallel robot for the production of
translational motions, currently under development at Ecole Centrale de Nantes
for machining applications.

"The Design of Parallel Kinematic Machine Tools Using Kinetostatic
  Performance Criteria","  Most industrial machine tools have a serial kinematic architecture, which
means that each axis has to carry the following one, including its actuators
and joints. High Speed Machining highlights some drawbacks of such
architectures: heavy moving parts require from the machine structure high
stiffness to limit bending problems that lower the machine accuracy, and limit
the dynamic performances of the feed axes. That is why PKMs attract more and
more researchers and companies, because they are claimed to offer several
advantages over their serial counterparts, like high structural rigidity and
high dynamic capacities. Indeed, the parallel kinematic arrangement of the
links provides higher stiffness and lower moving masses that reduce inertia
effects. Thus, PKMs have better dynamic performances. However, the design of a
parallel kinematic machine tool (PKMT) is a hard task that requires further
research studies before wide industrial use can be expected. Many criteria need
to be taken into account in the design of a PKMT. We pay special attention to
the description of kinetostatic criteria that rely on the conditioning of the
Jacobian matrix of the mechanism. The organisation of this paper is as follows:
next section introduces general remarks about PKMs, then is explained why PKMs
can be interesting alternative machine tool designs. Then are presented
existing PKMTs. An application to the design of a small-scale machine tool
prototype developed at IRCCyN is presented at the end of this paper.

"The Design of Parallel Kinematic Machine Tools Using Kinetostatic
  Performance Criteria","The paper presents a novel approach for designing parallel kinematic machine tools (PKMTs) using Kinetostatic Performance Criteria (KPC) as the basis for design optimization. The KPC approach considers the dynamic performance of the machine tool, such as its stiffness, accuracy, and workspace, in addition to its kinematic performance. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the KPC approach through a case study involving the design of a 5-axis PKMT. The results show that the KPC approach can significantly improve the performance of PKMTs compared to traditional design approaches. The paper concludes that the KPC approach can provide a valuable tool for the design and optimization of PKMTs in various applications.",2007-05-23,True
"Statistical Mechanics of the Glass Transition in One-Component Liquids
  with Anisotropic Potential","  We study a recently introduced model of one-component glass-forming liquids
whose constituents interact with anisotropic potential. This system is
interesting per-se and as a model of liquids like glycerol (interacting via
hydrogen bonds) which are excellent glass formers. We work out the statistical
mechanics of this system, encoding the liquid and glass disorder using
appropriate quasi-particles (36 of them). The theory provides a full
explanation of the glass transition phenomenology, including the identification
of a diverging length scale and a relation between the structural changes and
the diverging relaxation times.

"Statistical Mechanics of the Glass Transition in One-Component Liquids
  with Anisotropic Potential","The glass transition in one-component liquids with anisotropic potential is a fundamental problem in statistical mechanics. In this research paper, we investigate the mechanism of glass transition using computer simulations and theoretical analysis. Our results show that the anisotropy of the potential has a significant impact on the glass-forming ability of the liquid. We find that the glass transition occurs when the relaxation time of the liquid becomes extremely long, and the system becomes stuck in a metastable state. Moreover, we show that the dynamics of the glass transition can be described by a mode-coupling theory, which predicts the existence of a critical point separating the liquid and glass phases. Our findings provide insight into the fundamental physics of glass transition and have important implications for materials science and engineering.",2009-11-13,True
"Couplings between a single massless tensor field with the mixed symmetry
  (3,1) and one vector field","  Under the hypotheses of smoothness in the coupling constant, locality,
Lorentz covariance, and Poincare invariance of the deformations, combined with
the preservation of the number of derivatives on each field, the consistent
interactions between a single free massless tensor gauge field with the mixed
symmetry of a two-column Young diagram of the type (3,1) and one Abelian vector
field have been investigated. The computations are done with the help of the
deformation theory based on a cohomological approach, in the context of the
antifield-BRST formalism. The main result is that there exist nontrivial
cross-couplings between these types of fields in five spatiotemporal
dimensions, which break the PT invariance and allow for the deformation of the
gauge transformations of the vector field, but not of the gauge algebra.
