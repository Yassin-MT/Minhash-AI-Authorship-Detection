"Justification of the coupled-mode approximation for a nonlinear elliptic
  problem with a periodic potential","  Coupled-mode systems are used in physical literature to simplify the
nonlinear Maxwell and Gross-Pitaevskii equations with a small periodic
potential and to approximate localized solutions called gap solitons by
analytical expressions involving hyperbolic functions. We justify the use of
the one-dimensional stationary coupled-mode system for a relevant elliptic
problem by employing the method of Lyapunov--Schmidt reductions in Fourier
space. In particular, existence of periodic/anti-periodic and decaying
solutions is proved and the error terms are controlled in suitable norms. The
use of multi-dimensional stationary coupled-mode systems is justified for
analysis of bifurcations of periodic/anti-periodic solutions in a small
multi-dimensional periodic potential.

"Justification of the coupled-mode approximation for a nonlinear elliptic
  problem with a periodic potential","This research paper investigates the justification of the coupled-mode approximation for a nonlinear elliptic problem with a periodic potential. The coupled-mode approximation is a commonly used method for approximating solutions to nonlinear problems in physics and engineering. However, its validity for nonlinear elliptic problems with periodic potentials has not been fully explored. In this paper, we present numerical simulations and theoretical analysis to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the coupled-mode approximation in this particular context. Our results show that the coupled-mode approximation is a reliable method for approximating solutions to nonlinear elliptic problems with periodic potentials, and can be used in a wide range of applications in physics and engineering.",2009-11-13,True
Moving gap solitons in periodic potentials,"  We address existence of moving gap solitons (traveling localized solutions)
in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a small periodic potential. Moving gap
solitons are approximated by the explicit localized solutions of the
coupled-mode system. We show however that exponentially decaying traveling
solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation do not generally exist in the
presence of a periodic potential due to bounded oscillatory tails ahead and
behind the moving solitary waves. The oscillatory tails are not accounted in
the coupled-mode formalism and are estimated by using techniques of spatial
dynamics and local center-stable manifold reductions. Existence of bounded
traveling solutions of the Gross--Pitaevskii equation with a single bump
surrounded by oscillatory tails on a finite large interval of the spatial scale
is proven by using these technique. We also show generality of oscillatory
tails in other nonlinear equations with a periodic potential.

Strange stars and the cosmological constant problem,"  The cosmological constant problem represents an evident tension between our
present description of gravity and particle physics. Many solutions have been
proposed, but experimental tests are always difficult or impossible to perform

contemporary universe. Here I suggest that strange stars, if they exist, could
represent an interesting laboratory to investigate this puzzle, since their

Strange stars and the cosmological constant problem,"The research paper titled ""Strange stars and the cosmological constant problem"" explores the relationship between strange stars and the cosmological constant problem, which is a major mystery in modern astrophysics. The paper suggests that strange stars, which are hypothetical objects made entirely of strange quarks, may hold the key to solving the cosmological constant problem.

The paper presents a detailed analysis of the properties of strange stars and how they can be used to explain the observed acceleration of the expansion of the universe. The authors argue that strange stars can create a gravitational repulsion that is strong enough to counteract the effects of dark energy, which is the leading explanation for the observed acceleration.

The paper also discusses the implications of the proposed solution to the cosmological constant problem, including the possibility of new insights into the fundamental nature of matter and the universe as a whole. The authors conclude that further research into strange stars is necessary to fully understand their properties and potential role in solving the cosmological constant problem.

Overall, the paper offers an intriguing new perspective on the cosmological constant problem and suggests that strange stars may be an important piece of the puzzle.",2014-11-18,True
Graphene bilayer with a twist: electronic structure,"  Electronic properties of bilayer and multilayer graphene have generally been
interpreted in terms of AB or Bernal stacking. However, it is known that many
types of stacking defects can occur in natural and synthetic graphite; rotation
of the top layer is often seen in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies
of graphite. In this paper we consider a graphene bilayer with a relative small
angle rotation between the layers and calculate the electronic structure near
zero energy in a continuum approximation. Contrary to what happens in a AB
stacked bilayer and in accord with observations in epitaxial graphene we find:
(a) the low energy dispersion is linear, as in a single layer, but the Fermi
velocity can be significantly smaller than the single layer value; (b) an
external electric field, perpendicular to the layers, does not open an

Velocity selection problem in the presence of the triple junction,"The research paper titled ""Velocity selection problem in the presence of the triple junction"" aims to investigate the effect of the triple junction on the velocity selection problem in materials science. The triple junction is a common feature in polycrystalline materials, where three grain boundaries meet at a point. The researchers used computer simulations to study the behavior of atoms at the triple junction under various conditions.

The main objective of the study was to understand how the triple junction affects the velocity selection problem, which is a phenomenon where atoms with different velocities have different probabilities of being incorporated into the crystal lattice. The researchers found that the presence of the triple junction can significantly affect the velocity selection process, leading to the formation of disordered regions in the crystal lattice.

The study also revealed that the triple junction acts as a barrier to the movement of atoms, which can lead to the formation of defects and dislocations in the crystal lattice. The researchers suggest that understanding the role of the triple junction in the velocity selection problem can help to improve the mechanical properties of polycrystalline materials and prevent the formation of defects.

In conclusion, the research paper highlights the importance of studying the behavior of atoms at the triple junction in materials science. The study provides valuable insights into the velocity selection problem and its impact on the mechanical properties of polycrystalline materials.

Radio Lobes of Pictor A: an X-ray spatially resolved Study,"  A new XMM observation has made possible a detailed study of both lobes of the
radio galaxy Pictor A. Their X-ray emission is of non thermal origin and due to
Inverse Compton scattering of the microwave background photons by relativistic
electrons in the lobes, as previously found. In both lobes, the equipartition
magnetic field (Beq) is bigger than the Inverse Compton value (Bic), calculated
from the radio and X-ray flux ratio. The Beq/Bic ratio never gets below 2, in
spite of the large number of reasonable assumptions tested to calculate Beq,
suggesting a lobe energetic dominated by particles. The X-ray data quality is
good enough to allow a spatially resolved analysis. Our study shows that Bic
varies through the lobes. It appears to increase behind the hot spots. On the
contrary, a rather uniform distribution of the particles is observed. As a
consequence, the radio flux density variation along the lobes appears to be
mainly driven by magnetic field changes.

"A quantitative study on the growth variability of tumour cell clones in
  vitro","  Objectives: In this study, we quantify the growth variability of tumour cell
clones from a human leukemia cell line. Materials and methods: We have used
microplate spectrophotometry to measure the growth kinetics of hundreds of
individual cell clones from the Molt3 cell line. The growth rate of each clonal
population has been estimated by fitting experimental data with the logistic
equation. Results: The growth rates were observed to vary among different
clones. Up to six clones with a growth rate above or below the mean growth rate
of the parent population were further cloned and the growth rates of their
offsprings were measured. The distribution of the growth rates of the subclones
did not significantly differ from that of the parent population thus suggesting
that growth variability has an epigenetic origin. To explain the observed
distributions of clonal growth rates we have developed a probabilistic model
assuming that the fluctuations in the number of mitochondria through successive
cell cycles are the leading cause of growth variability. For fitting purposes,
we have estimated experimentally by flow cytometry the maximum average number
of mitochondria in Molt3 cells. The model fits nicely the observed
distributions of growth rates, however, cells in which the mitochondria were
rendered non functional (rho-0 cells) showed only a 30% reduction in the clonal
growth variability with respect to normal cells. Conclusions: A tumor cell
population is a dynamic ensemble of clones with highly variable growth rate. At
least part of this variability is due to fluctuations in the number of
mitochondria.

"Differentially rotating force-free magnetosphere of an aligned rotator:
  analytical solutions in split-monopole approximation","  In this paper we consider stationary force-free magnetosphere of an aligned
rotator when plasma in the open field line region rotates differentially due to
presence of a zone with the accelerating electric field in the polar cap of

distribution in the magnetosphere. Using split-monopole approximation we obtain
analytical expressions for physical parameters of differentially rotating

vacuum potential drop. We show that the current density distribution could
deviate significantly from the ``classical'' Michel distribution and could be
made almost constant over the polar cap even when the potential drop in the
accelerating zone is of the order of 10 per cents of the vacuum potential drop.
We argue that differential rotation of the open magnetic field lines could play

Continuous Capillary Condensation,"  We show that condensation in a capped capillary slit is a continuous

Characterization of Instrumental Phase Stability,"  Atmospheric water vapor causes significant undesired phase fluctuations for

Boolean network model predicts cell cycle sequence of fission yeast,"  A Boolean network model of the cell-cycle regulatory network of fission yeast
(Schizosaccharomyces Pombe) is constructed solely on the basis of the known
biochemical interaction topology. Simulating the model in the computer,
faithfully reproduces the known sequence of regulatory activity patterns along
the cell cycle of the living cell. Contrary to existing differential equation
models, no parameters enter the model except the structure of the regulatory
circuitry. The dynamical properties of the model indicate that the biological
dynamical sequence is robustly implemented in the regulatory network, with the
biological stationary state G1 corresponding to the dominant attractor in state
space, and with the biological regulatory sequence being a strongly attractive
trajectory. Comparing the fission yeast cell-cycle model to a similar model of
the corresponding network in S. cerevisiae, a remarkable difference in
circuitry, as well as dynamics is observed. While the latter operates in a
strongly damped mode, driven by external excitation, the S. pombe network
represents an auto-excited system with external damping.

"Rotational Widths for Use in the Tully-Fisher Relation. II. The Impact
  of Surface Brightness","  Using a large sample of spiral galaxies for which 21 cm single-dish and/or
long-slit optical spectra are available, we make a detailed comparison between
various estimates of rotational widths. Different optical width estimators are
considered and their limitations discussed, with emphasis on biases associated
with rotation curve properties (shape and extent) and disk central surface
brightness. The best match with HI rotational velocities is obtained with
Polyex widths, which are measured at the optical radius (encompassing a fixed
fraction of the total light of the galaxy) from a model fit to the rotation
curve. In contrast with Polyex widths, optical rotational velocities measured
at 2.15 disk scale lengths r_d deviate from HI widths by an amount that
correlates with the central surface brightness of the disk. This bias occurs
because the rotation curves of galaxies are in general still rising at 2.15
r_d, and the fraction of total mass contained within this radius decreases with
increasing disk surface brightness. Statistical corrections, parameterized by
the radial extent of the observed rotation curve, are provided to reduce Polyex
and HI width measurements into a homogeneous system. This yields a single
robust estimate of rotational velocity to be used for applications of disk
scaling relations.

Front propagation into unstable metal nanowires,"  Long, cylindrical metal nanowires have recently been observed to form and be

a coherent pattern behind it. It is well described by a linear marginal

Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking as a Basis of Particle Mass,"  Electroweak theory joins electromagnetism with the weak force in a single
quantum field theory, ascribing the two fundamental interactions--so different
in their manifestations--to a common symmetry principle. How the electroweak
gauge symmetry is hidden is one of the most urgent and challenging questions
facing particle physics. The provisional answer incorporated in the ""standard
model"" of particle physics was formulated in the 1960s by Higgs, by Brout &
Englert, and by Guralnik, Hagen & Kibble: The agent of electroweak symmetry
breaking is an elementary scalar field whose self-interactions select a vacuum
state in which the full electroweak symmetry is hidden, leaving a residual
phase symmetry of electromagnetism. By analogy with the Meissner effect of the
superconducting phase transition, the Higgs mechanism, as it is commonly known,
confers masses on the weak force carriers W and Z. It also opens the door to
masses for the quarks and leptons, and shapes the world around us. It is a good
story--though an incomplete story--and we do not know how much of the story is
true. Experiments that explore the Fermi scale (the energy regime around 1 TeV)
during the next decade will put the electroweak theory to decisive test, and

jet models with parameters representative of the symbiotic system MWC 560.
These were simulations of a pulsed, initially underdense jet in a high density

show extended and variable X-ray emission which can be characterized as a sum
of hot and warm components with temperatures that are consistent with
observations of CH Cyg and R Aqr. The X-ray spectra of our model jets show
emission line features which correspond to observed features in the spectra of
CH Cyg. The innermost parts of our pulsed jets show iron line emission in the
6.4 - 6.7 keV range which may explain such emission from the central source in

Hydrodynamic Limit for a Particle System with degenerate rates,"  We study the hydrodynamic limit for some conservative particle systems with
degenerate rates, namely with nearest neighbor exchange rates which vanish for
certain configurations. These models belong to the class of {\sl kinetically
constrained lattice gases} (KCLG) which have been introduced and intensively

Due to the degeneracy of rates for KCLG there exists {\sl blocked
configurations} which do not evolve under the dynamics and in general the
hyperplanes of configurations with a fixed number of particles can be
decomposed into different irreducible sets. As a consequence, both the Entropy
and Relative Entropy method cannot be straightforwardly applied to prove the
hydrodynamic limit. In particular, some care should be put when proving the One
and Two block Lemmas which guarantee local convergence to equilibrium. We show
that, for initial profiles smooth enough and bounded away from zero and one,
the macroscopic density profile for our KCLG evolves under the diffusive time
scaling according to the porous medium equation. Then we prove the same result
for more general profiles for a slightly perturbed dynamics obtained by adding
jumps of the Symmetric Simple Exclusion. The role of the latter is to remove
the degeneracy of rates and at the same time they are properly slowed down in

Chaos and Complexity of quantum motion,"  The problem of characterizing complexity of quantum dynamics - in particular
of locally interacting chains of quantum particles - will be reviewed and
discussed from several different perspectives: (i) stability of motion against

"Dust Formation and He II 4686 emission in the Dense Shell of the
  Peculiar Type Ib Supernova 2006jc","  We present evidence for the formation of dust grains in an unusual Type Ib SN
based on late-time spectra of SN 2006jc. The progenitor suffered an LBV-like
outburst just 2 yr earlier, and we propose that the dust formation is a
consequence of the SN blast wave overtaking that LBV-like shell. The key
evidence for dust formation is (a) the appearance of a red/near-IR continuum
source fit by 1600 K graphite grains, and (b) fading of the redshifted sides of
He I emission lines, yielding progressively more asymmetric blueshifted lines
as dust obscures receding material. This provides the strongest case yet for
dust formation in any SN Ib/c. Both developments occurred between 51 and 75 d
after peak, while other SNe observed to form dust did so after a few hundred
days. Geometric considerations indicate that dust formed in the dense swept-up
shell between the forward and reverse shocks, and not in the freely expanding
SN ejecta. Rapid cooling leading to dust formation may have been aided by
extremely high shell densities, as indicated by He I line ratios. The brief
epoch of dust formation is accompanied by He II 4686 emission and enhanced
X-ray emission. These clues suggest that the unusual dust formation in this
object was not due to properties of the SN itself, but instead -- like most
peculiarities of SN 2006jc -- was a consequence of the dense environment
created by an LBV-like eruption 2 yr before the SN.

"Scaling Behaviors of Graphene Nanoribbon FETs: A Three Dimensional
  Quantum Simulation Study","  The scaling behaviors of graphene nanoribbon (GNR) Schottky barrier
field-effect transistors (SBFETs) are studied by solving the non-equilibrium
Green's function (NEGF) transport equation in an atomistic basis set
self-consistently with a three-dimensional Poisson equation. The armchair edge
GNR channel shares similarities with a zigzag CNT, but it has a different
geometry and quantum confinement boundary condition in the transverse
direction. The results indicate that the I-V characteristics are ambipolar and
strongly depend on the GNR width because the bandgap of the GNR is
approximately inversely proportional to its width, which agrees with recent
experiments. A multiple gate geometry improves immunity to short channel
effects, but it offers smaller improvement than it does for Si MOSFETs in terms
of the on-current and transconductance. Reducing the oxide thickness is more
useful for improving transistor performance than using a high-k gate insulator.
Significant increase of the minimal leakage current is observed when the
channel length is scaled below 10nm because the small effective mass
facilitates strong source-drain tunneling. The GNRFET, therefore, does not
promise extending the ultimate scaling limit of Si MOSFETs. The intrinsic
switching speed of a GNR SBFET, however, is several times faster than that of

"Temporal and diffraction effects in entanglement creation in an optical

inside a single-mode optical cavity is discussed. We show that the degree of
entanglement and the time it takes for the entanglement to reach its optimum
value is a sensitive function the initial conditions and the position of the

two atoms can readily be extracted from dynamics of a simple two-level system.
Effectively, we engineer two coupled qubits whose the dynamics are analogous to
that of a driven single two-level system. It is found that spatial variations
of the coupling constants actually help to create transient entanglement which
may appear on the time scale much longer than that predicted for the case of
equal coupling constants. When the atoms are initially prepared in an entangled
state, they may remain entangled for all times. We also find that the
entanglement exhibits an interesting phenomenon of diffraction when the the
atoms are located between the nodes and antinodes of the cavity mode. The
diffraction pattern of the entanglement varies with time and we explain this
effect in terms of the quantum property of complementarity, which is manifested
as a tradeoff between the knowledge of energy of the exchanged photon versus

"Cosmological Symmetry Breaking, Pseudo-scale invariance, Dark Energy and

energy of a slowly rolling scalar field. Making a quantum expansion around such

breaking. We illustrate this with a toy scalar field theory, whose action
displays a U(1) symmetry. We identify a symmetry, called pseudo-scale
invariance, which sets the cosmological constant exactly equal to zero, both in
classical and quantum theory. This symmetry is also broken cosmologically and
leads to a nonzero vacuum or dark energy. The slow roll condition along with
the observed value of dark energy leads to a value of the background scalar
field of the order of Planck mass. We also consider a U(1) gauge symmetry

Discrete Choices under Social Influence: Generic Properties,"  We consider a model of socially interacting individuals that make a binary
choice in a context of positive additive endogenous externalities. It
encompasses as particular cases several models from the sociology and economics
literature. We extend previous results to the case of a general distribution of
idiosyncratic preferences, called here Idiosyncratic Willingnesses to Pay
(IWP). Positive additive externalities yield a family of inverse demand curves
that include the classical downward sloping ones but also new ones with non
constant convexity. When j, the ratio of the social influence strength to the
standard deviation of the IWP distribution, is small enough, the inverse demand
is a classical monotonic (decreasing) function of the adoption rate. Even if
the IWP distribution is mono-modal, there is a critical value of j above which
the inverse demand is non monotonic, decreasing for small and high adoption
rates, but increasing within some intermediate range. Depending on the price
there are thus either one or two equilibria. Beyond this first result, we
exhibit the generic properties of the boundaries limiting the regions where the
system presents different types of equilibria (unique or multiple). These
properties are shown to depend only on qualitative features of the IWP

On Predicting the Solar Cycle using Mean-Field Models,"  We discuss the difficulties of predicting the solar cycle using mean-field
models. Here we argue that these difficulties arise owing to the significant
modulation of the solar activity cycle, and that this modulation arises owing
to either stochastic or deterministic processes. We analyse the implications
for predictability in both of these situations by considering two separate
solar dynamo models. The first model represents a stochastically-perturbed flux
transport dynamo. Here even very weak stochastic perturbations can give rise to
significant modulation in the activity cycle. This modulation leads to a loss
of predictability. In the second model, we neglect stochastic effects and
assume that generation of magnetic field in the Sun can be described by a fully
deterministic nonlinear mean-field model -- this is a best case scenario for
prediction. We designate the output from this deterministic model (with
parameters chosen to produce chaotically modulated cycles) as a target
timeseries that subsequent deterministic mean-field models are required to
predict. Long-term prediction is impossible even if a model that is correct in
all details is utilised in the prediction. Furthermore, we show that even
short-term prediction is impossible if there is a small discrepancy in the
input parameters from the fiducial model. This is the case even if the
predicting model has been tuned to reproduce the output of previous cycles.
Given the inherent uncertainties in determining the transport coefficients and
nonlinear responses for mean-field models, we argue that this makes predicting
the solar cycle using the output from such models impossible.

Quantum Master Equation for QED in Exact Renormalization Group,"  Recently, one of us (H.S.) gave an explicit form of the Ward-Takahashi

Scaling Laws of Cognitive Networks,"  We consider a cognitive network consisting of n random pairs of cognitive
transmitters and receivers communicating simultaneously in the presence of
multiple primary users. Of interest is how the maximum throughput achieved by
the cognitive users scales with n. Furthermore, how far these users must be
from a primary user to guarantee a given primary outage. Two scenarios are
considered for the network scaling law: (i) when each cognitive transmitter
uses constant power to communicate with a cognitive receiver at a bounded
distance away, and (ii) when each cognitive transmitter scales its power
according to the distance to a considered primary user, allowing the cognitive
transmitter-receiver distances to grow. Using single-hop transmission, suitable
for cognitive devices of opportunistic nature, we show that, in both scenarios,
with path loss larger than 2, the cognitive network throughput scales linearly
with the number of cognitive users. We then explore the radius of a primary
exclusive region void of cognitive transmitters. We obtain bounds on this
radius for a given primary outage constraint. These bounds can help in the
design of a primary network with exclusive regions, outside of which cognitive
users may transmit freely. Our results show that opportunistic secondary

dimension is a robust notion by giving an equivalent characterization of BPD
dimension in terms of BPD compressors. We then study the relationships between
BPD compression, and the standard Lempel-Ziv (LZ) compression algorithm, and
show that in contrast to the finite-state compressor case, LZ is not universal

"Neglecting the porosity of hot-star winds can lead to underestimating
  mass-loss rates","  Context: The mass-loss rate is a key parameter of massive stars. Adequate
stellar atmosphere models are required for spectral analyses and mass-loss
determinations. Present models can only account for the inhomogeneity of
stellar winds in the approximation of small-scale structures that are optically
thin. This treatment of ``microclumping'' has led to reducing empirical
mass-loss rates by factors of two and more. Aims: Stellar wind clumps can be
optically thick in spectral lines. We investigate how this ``macroclumping''
impacts on empirical mass-loss rates. Methods: The Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR)
model atmosphere code is generalized in the ``formal integral'' to account for
clumps that are not necessarily optically thin. Results: Optically thick clumps
reduce the effective opacity. This has a pronounced effect on the emergent
spectrum. Our modeling for the O-type supergiant zeta Puppis reveals that the
optically thin H-alpha line is not affected by wind porosity, but that the PV
resonance doublet becomes significantly weaker when macroclumping is taken into
account. The reported discrepancies between resonance-line and
recombination-line diagnostics can be resolved entirely with the macroclumping
modeling without downward revision of the mass-loss rate. Conclusions:
Mass-loss rates inferred from optically thin emission, such as the H-alpha line
in O stars, are not influenced by macroclumping. The strength of optically
thick lines, however, is reduced because of the porosity effects. Therefore,
neglecting the porosity in stellar wind modeling can lead to underestimating
empirical mass-loss rates.

"Radio Spectral Evolution of an X-ray Poor Impulsive Solar Flare:
  Implications for Plasma Heating and Electron Acceleration","  We present radio and X-ray observations of an impulsive solar flare that was
moderately intense in microwaves, yet showed very meager EUV and X-ray
emission. The flare occurred on 2001 Oct 24 and was well-observed at radio
wavelengths by the Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH), the Nobeyama Radio
Polarimeters (NoRP), and by the Owens Valley Solar Array (OVSA). It was also
observed in EUV and X-ray wavelength bands by the TRACE, GOES, and Yohkoh

progressively delayed with increasing frequency relative to the onset of hard
X-ray emission. In contrast, the time of flux density maximum is progressively
delayed with decreasing frequency. The decay phase is independent of radio
frequency. The simple source morphology and the excellent spectral coverage at
radio wavelengths allowed us to employ a nonlinear chi-squared minimization
scheme to fit the time series of radio spectra to a source model that accounts
for the observed radio emission in terms of gyrosynchrotron radiation from
MeV-energy electrons in a relatively dense thermal plasma. We discuss plasma

The Spectral Index Distribution of EGRET Blazars: Prospects for GLAST,"  The intrinsic distribution of spectral indices in GeV energies of
gamma-ray--loud blazars is a critical input in determining the spectral shape
of the unresolved blazar contribution to the diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray
background, as well as an important test of blazar emission theories. We
present a maximum-likelihood method of determining the intrinsic spectral index
distribution (ISID) of a population of gamma-ray emitters which accounts for

indication that FSRQs and BL Lacs may have different ISIDs (with BL Lacs being
harder). We also test for spectral index hardening associated with blazar
variability for which we find no evidence. Finally, we produce simulated GLAST
spectral index datasets and perform the same analyses. With improved statistics
due to the much larger number of resolvable blazars, GLAST data will help us
determine the ISIDs with much improved accuracy. Should any difference exist

"Searching for Earth analogues around the nearest stars: the disk
  age-metallicity relation and the age distribution in the Solar Neighbourhood","  The chemical composition of Earth's atmosphere has undergone substantial
evolution over the course of its history. It is possible, even likely, that
terrestrial planets in other planetary systems have undergone similar changes;
consequently, the age distribution of nearby stars is an important
consideration in designing surveys for Earth-analogues. Valenti & Fischer
(2005) provide age and metallicity estimates for 1039 FGK dwarfs in the Solar
Neighbourhood. Using the Hipparcos catalogue as a reference to calibrate
potential biases, we have extracted volume-limited samples of nearby stars from
the Valenti-Fischer dataset. Unlike other recent investigations, our analysis
shows clear evidence for an age-metallicity relation in the local disk, albeit
with substantial dispersion at any epoch. The mean metallicity increases from
-0.3 dex at a lookback time of ~10 Gyrs to +0.15 dex at the present day.
Supplementing the Valenti-Fischer measurements with literature data to give a
complete volume-limited sample, the age distribution of nearby FGK dwarfs is
broadly consistent with a uniform star-formation rate over the history of the
Galactic disk. In striking contrast, most stars known to have planetary
companions are younger than 5 Gyrs; however, stars with planetary companions
within 0.4 AU have a significantly flatter age distribution, indicating that
those systems are stable on timescales of many Gyrs. Several of the older,
lower metallicity host stars have enhanced [alpha/Fe] ratios, implying
membership of the thick disk. If the frequency of terrestrial planets is also
correlated with stellar metallicity, then the median age of such planetary
system is likely to be ~3 Gyrs. We discuss the implications of this hypothesis
in designing searches for Earth analogues among the nearby stars.

Optimum Linear LLR Calculation for Iterative Decoding on Fading Channels,"  On a fading channel with no channel state information at the receiver,

achievable rate under this linear LLR calculation is almost equal to the
maximum achievable rate under true LLR calculation. We also observe that this

GRB blastwaves through wind-shaped circumburst media,"  Context:A significant fraction of progenitors for long gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) are believed to be massive stars. The investigation of long GRBs
therefore requires modeling the propagation of ultra-relativistic blastwaves
through the circumburst medium surrounding massive stars. We simulate the
expansion of an isotropic, adiabatic relativistic fireball into the wind-shaped
medium around a massive GRB progenitor. The circumburst medium is composed of a
realistically stratified stellar wind zone up to its termination shock,
followed by a region of shocked wind characterized by a constant density. Aims:
We followed the evolution of the blastwave through all its stages, including
the extremely rapid acceleration up to a Lorentz factor 75 flow, its
deceleration by interaction with stellar wind, its passage of the wind
termination shock, until its propagation through shocked wind. Methods: We used
the adaptive mesh refinement versatile advection code to follow the evolution
of the fireball. Results: We show that the acceleration from purely thermal to
ultra-relativistic kinetic regimes is abrupt and produces an internally
structured blastwave. We resolved the structure of this ultra-relativistic
shell in all stages, thanks to the adaptive mesh. We comment on the dynamical
roles played by forward and reverse shock pairs in the phase of interaction
with the free stellar wind and clearly identify the complex shock-dominated
structure created when the shell crosses the terminal shock. Conclusion: We
show that in our model where the terminal shock is taken relatively close to
the massive star, the phase of self-similar deceleration of Blandford-McKee

Is diversity good?,"  Prominent ethical and policy issues such as affirmative action and female
enrollment in science and engineering revolve around the idea that diversity is
good. However, even though diversity is an ambiguous concept, a precise
definition is seldom provided. We show that diversity may be construed as a
factual description, a craving for symmetry, an intrinsic good, an instrumental
good, a symptom, or a side effect. These acceptions differ vastly in their
nature and properties. The first one cannot lead to any action and the second
one is mistaken. Diversity as intrinsic good is a mere opinion, which cannot be
concretely applied; moreover, the most commonly invoked forms of diversity
(sexual and racial) are not intrinsically good. On the other hand, diversity as
instrumental good can be evaluated empirically and can give rise to policies,
but these may be very weak. Finally, symptoms and side effects are not actually

Physical Layer Network Coding,"  A main distinguishing feature of a wireless network compared with a wired

advantage in wireless ad hoc networks. Specifically, we propose a
physical-layer network coding (PNC) scheme to coordinate transmissions among
nodes. In contrast to straightforward network coding which performs coding
arithmetic on digital bit streams after they have been received, PNC makes use
of the additive nature of simultaneously arriving electromagnetic (EM) waves
for equivalent coding operation. And in doing so, PNC can potentially achieve
100% and 50% throughput increases compared with traditional transmission and
straightforward network coding, respectively, in multi-hop networks. More
specifically, the information-theoretic capacity of PNC is almost double that

"On the change of latitude of Arctic East Siberia at the end of the
  Pleistocene","  Mammoths lived in Arctic East Siberia. In this region there is not sufficient
sunlight over the year for the growth of the plants on which these animals
feed. Therefore the latitude of this region was lower before the end of the
Pleistocene. As the cause of this geographic pole shift, we postulate a massive
object, which moved in an extremely eccentric orbit and was hot from tidal work
and solar radiation. Evaporation produced a disk-shaped cloud of ions around
the Sun. This cloud partially shielded the solar radiation, producing the cold
and warm periods that characterize the Pleistocene. The shielding depends on
the inclination of Earth's orbit, which has a period of 100'000 years. The
cloud builds up to a density at which inelastic particle collisions induce its
collapse The resulting near-periodic time dependence resembles that of
Dansgaard-Oeschger events. During cold periods fine grained inclusions were
deposited into the ice. The Pleistocene ended when the massive object had a
close encounter with the Earth, which suffered a one per mil stretching
deformation. While the deformation relaxed to an equilibrium shape in one to
several years, the globe turned relative to the rotation axis: The North Pole

"On the change of latitude of Arctic East Siberia at the end of the
  Pleistocene","The research paper titled ""On the change of latitude of Arctic East Siberia at the end of the Pleistocene"" focuses on understanding the changes in the Earth's crust that occurred during the end of the Pleistocene epoch, particularly in the Arctic East Siberia region. The central theme of the study is the examination of how the shift in latitude of the Arctic East Siberia region during the end of the Pleistocene epoch influenced the climate and the environment. 

The study uses geodetic observations, paleomagnetic data, and numerical simulations to analyze the movement and deformation of the Earth's crust in the Arctic East Siberia region during the end of the Pleistocene epoch. The study found that the Arctic East Siberia region experienced significant changes in latitude during the end of the Pleistocene epoch.

"The effect of stellar-mass black holes on the structural evolution of
  massive star clusters","  We present the results of realistic N-body modelling of massive star clusters
in the Magellanic Clouds, aimed at investigating a dynamical origin for the
radius-age trend observed in these systems. We find that stellar-mass black
holes, formed in the supernova explosions of the most massive cluster stars,
can constitute a dynamically important population. If a significant number of
black holes are retained (here we assume complete retention), these objects
rapidly form a dense core where interactions are common, resulting in the
scattering of black holes into the cluster halo, and the ejection of black
holes from the cluster. These two processes heat the stellar component,
resulting in prolonged core expansion of a magnitude matching the observations.
Significant core evolution is also observed in Magellanic Cloud clusters at
early times. We find that this does not result from the action of black holes,
but can be reproduced by the effects of mass-loss due to rapid stellar
evolution in a primordially mass segregated cluster.

An experimental test of non-local realism,"  Most working scientists hold fast to the concept of 'realism' - a viewpoint
according to which an external reality exists independent of observation. But
quantum physics has shattered some of our cornerstone beliefs. According to
Bell's theorem, any theory that is based on the joint assumption of realism and
locality (meaning that local events cannot be affected by actions in space-like
separated regions) is at variance with certain quantum predictions. Experiments
with entangled pairs of particles have amply confirmed these quantum
predictions, thus rendering local realistic theories untenable. Maintaining
realism as a fundamental concept would therefore necessitate the introduction
of 'spooky' actions that defy locality. Here we show by both theory and
experiment that a broad and rather reasonable class of such non-local realistic
theories is incompatible with experimentally observable quantum correlations.
In the experiment, we measure previously untested correlations between two
entangled photons, and show that these correlations violate an inequality
proposed by Leggett for non-local realistic theories. Our result suggests that
giving up the concept of locality is not sufficient to be consistent with
quantum experiments, unless certain intuitive features of realism are
abandoned.

is revealed through the presence of both forward and reverse shocks, with a
separating contact discontinuity. The effects of radiative cooling are
investigated and key outburst parameters such as mass-loss rate, ejecta
velocity and mass are varied. The shock velocities as a function of time are
compared to the ones derived in Paper I. We show how the manner in which the
matter is ejected controls the evolution of the shock and that for a
well-cooled remnant, the shock deceleration rate depends on the amount of
energy that is radiated away.

Inferring dynamic genetic networks with low order independencies,"  In this paper, we propose a novel inference method for dynamic genetic
networks which makes it possible to face with a number of time measurements n
much smaller than the number of genes p. The approach is based on the concept
of low order conditional dependence graph that we extend here in the case of
Dynamic Bayesian Networks. Most of our results are based on the theory of
graphical models associated with the Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). In this
way, we define a minimal DAG G which describes exactly the full order
conditional dependencies given the past of the process. Then, to face with the
large p and small n estimation case, we propose to approximate DAG G by
considering low order conditional independencies. We introduce partial qth
order conditional dependence DAGs G(q) and analyze their probabilistic
properties. In general, DAGs G(q) differ from DAG G but still reflect relevant
dependence facts for sparse networks such as genetic networks. By using this
approximation, we set out a non-bayesian inference method and demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach on both simulated and real data analysis. The
inference procedure is implemented in the R package 'G1DBN' freely available

"Diffusion Processes on Small-World Networks with Distance-Dependent
  Random-Links","  We considered diffusion-driven processes on small-world networks with
distance-dependent random links. The study of diffusion on such networks is
motivated by transport on randomly folded polymer chains, synchronization
problems in task-completion networks, and gradient driven transport on
networks. Changing the parameters of the distance-dependence, we found a rich
phase diagram, with different transient and recurrent phases in the context of
random walks on networks. We performed the calculations in two limiting cases:
in the annealed case, where the rearrangement of the random links is fast, and
in the quenched case, where the link rearrangement is slow compared to the
motion of the random walker or the surface. It has been well-established that
in a large class of interacting systems, adding an arbitrarily small density
of, possibly long-range, quenched random links to a regular lattice interaction
topology, will give rise to mean-field (or annealed) like behavior. In some
cases, however, mean-field scaling breaks down, such as in diffusion or in the
Edwards-Wilkinson process in ""low-dimensional"" small-world networks. This
break-down can be understood by treating the random links perturbatively, where
the mean-field (or annealed) prediction appears as the lowest-order term of a
naive perturbation expansion. The asymptotic analytic results are also
confirmed numerically by employing exact numerical diagonalization of the
network Laplacian. Further, we construct a finite-size scaling framework for
the relevant observables, capturing the cross-over behaviors in finite
networks. This work provides a detailed account of the

Experimental studies on vacancy induced ferromagnetism in undoped TiO2,"  Room temperature ferromagnetism is observed in undoped TiO2 films deposited
on Si substrates using pulsed laser deposition (PLD). The ferromagnetic
properties of the samples depend on the oxygen partial pressure during the PLD
synthesis. The appearance of higher binding energy component (HBEC) in the
oxygen 1s core peak from x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) suggests the
presence of oxygen vacancies in these samples. The amount of oxygen during the
synthesis determines the vacancy concentration in the samples which is directly
related to the magnetic behavior of the samples. The magnetic moment decreases
with oxygen vacancy concentration in the samples. Valence band measurements
were performed to study the electronic structure of both stoichometric and
reduced TiO2. The analyses show the presence of Ti 3d band near the Fermi level
in reduced TiO2 samples. These bands are otherwise empty in stoichiometric TiO2
and reside in the conduction band which makes them unobservable by XPS. The
existence of this Ti 3d band near the Fermi level can possibly lead to Stoner
splitting of the band.

on the interaction strength and duration and show how these can be kept
negligible by a choice of smooth (e.g., Gaussian) envelope functions even in
situations that substantially violate the adiabaticity condition. We also give
an efficient method for calculating the effective Rabi frequency (which is

Linkage between Accretion Disks and Blazars,"  The magnetic field in an accretion disk is estimated assuming that all of the

"Observational consequences of the hypothesized helium rich stellar

the double main sequence observed in Omega Centauri, we investigated the

concentrated on the horizontal branch where the effects of high helium are

history is very different from that of the majority metal-poor stars. It is
possible to generate a double main sequence with existing Omega Centauri stars
via accretion of helium rich pollution consistent with the latest AGB ejecta
theoretical yields, and such polluted stars are consistent with the observed HB
morphology of Omega Centauri. Polluted models are consistent with observed
merging of the main sequences as opposed to our models of helium rich stars.

"Eclipsing light curves for accretion flows around a rotating black hole
  and atmospheric effects of the companion star","  We calculate eclipsing light curves for accretion flows around a rotating
black hole taking into account the atmospheric effects of the companion star.
In the cases of no atmospheric effects, the light curves contain the
information of the black hole spin because most of the X-ray photons around 1
keV usually come from the blueshifted part of the accretion flow near the black
hole shadow, and the size and the position of the black hole shadow depend on
the spin. In these cases, when most of the emission comes from the vicinity of
the event horizon, the light curves become asymmetric at ingress and egress. We
next investigate the atmospheric absorption and scattering effects of the
companion stars. By using the solar-type atmospheric model, we have taken into
account the atmospheric effects of the companion star, such as the
photoionization by HI and HeI. We found that the eclipsing light curves
observed at 1 keV possibly contain the information of the black hole spin.
However, in our atmospheric model, the effects of the atmosphere are much
larger than the effects of the black hole spin. Therefore, even in the case
that the light curves contain the information of the black hole spin, it may be
difficult to extract the information of the black hole spin if we do not have
the realistic atmospheric profiles, such as the temperature, and the number
densities for several elements. Even in such cases, the light-curve asymmetries
due to the rotation of the accretion disc exist. Only when we have the reliable
atmospheric model, in principle, the information of the strong-gravity regions,
