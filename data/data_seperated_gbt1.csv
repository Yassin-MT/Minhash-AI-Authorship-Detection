"Calculation of prompt diphoton production cross sections at Tevatron and
  LHC energies","  A fully differential calculation in perturbative quantum chromodynamics is
presented for the production of massive photon pairs at hadron colliders. All
next-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark,
gluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as
all-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at
next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is
specified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is
demonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for
more detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for
distributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs
boson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing
that enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious
selection of events.

"Calculation of prompt diphoton production cross sections at Tevatron and
  LHC energies","The research paper titled ""Calculation of prompt diphoton production cross sections at Tevatron and LHC energies"" aimed to calculate the production cross sections of prompt diphoton events at both Tevatron and LHC energies. The primary objective was to provide theoretical predictions for these cross sections, which could be compared with experimental data to test the validity of the Standard Model of particle physics. 

The researchers used the Next-to-Leading-Order (NLO) QCD calculations to predict the cross sections for diphoton production. They also compared their results with previous calculations and experimental data.

Polymer Quantum Mechanics and its Continuum Limit,"  A rather non-standard quantum representation of the canonical commutation
relations of quantum mechanics systems, known as the polymer representation has
gained some attention in recent years, due to its possible relation with Planck
scale physics. In particular, this approach has been followed in a symmetric
sector of loop quantum gravity known as loop quantum cosmology. Here we explore
different aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and
the polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derive
the polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory
and show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the
second part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse
process in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back
the ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics. We consider several examples of
interest, including the harmonic oscillator, the free particle and a simple
cosmological model.

  properties","  A general formulation was developed to represent material models for
applications in dynamic loading. Numerical methods were devised to calculate
response to shock and ramp compression, and ramp decompression, generalizing
previous solutions for scalar equations of state. The numerical methods were

Stochastic Lie group integrators,"  We present Lie group integrators for nonlinear stochastic differential
equations with non-commutative vector fields whose solution evolves on a smooth
finite dimensional manifold. Given a Lie group action that generates transport
along the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie
group via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding
Lie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the
stochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to
the Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in
the manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their
deterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration
schemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying
ordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a
truncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group
integrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary
differential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods are
uniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes.

ALMA as the ideal probe of the solar chromosphere,"  The very nature of the solar chromosphere, its structuring and dynamics,
remains far from being properly understood, in spite of intensive research.
Here we point out the potential of chromospheric observations at millimeter
wavelengths to resolve this long-standing problem. Computations carried out

dynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look
for dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests
that high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by
ALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool
gas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of
the solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of
the quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal
significant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8
mHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer

"Formation of quasi-solitons in transverse confined ferromagnetic film

stripes of ferrimagnetic film was observed by using time- and space-resolved
Brillouin light scattering technique. In the linear regime it was found that
the confinement decreases the amplitude of dynamic magnetization near the
lateral stripe edges. Thus, the so-called effective dipolar pinning of dynamic
magnetization takes place at the edges.
  In the nonlinear regime a new stable spin wave packet propagating along a

Tuning correlation effects with electron-phonon interactions,"  We investigate the effect of tuning the phonon energy on the correlation

Quantum Group of Isometries in Classical and Noncommutative Geometry,"  We formulate a quantum generalization of the notion of the group of

Nonequilibrium entropy limiters in lattice Boltzmann methods,"  We construct a system of nonequilibrium entropy limiters for the lattice

properties of LBM provide some additional benefits: the control of entropy
production and accurate estimate of introduced artificial dissipation are

"Astrophysical gyrokinetics: kinetic and fluid turbulent cascades in
  magnetized weakly collisional plasmas","  We present a theoretical framework for plasma turbulence in astrophysical
plasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks).
The key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the
mean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron
frequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted
into heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC
CASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and
velocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of
the physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically
reduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the ""inertial range"" above the
ion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic
fluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional
and collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,
which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated
with the Alfvenic component. In the ""dissipation range"" between the ion and
electron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave
(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive
phase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the
energy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless
wave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the
phase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the
electron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling
relations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical
applications are discussed in detail.

"Evolution of solitary waves and undular bores in shallow-water flows

variable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global
restrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the
leading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated
solitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to
nonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an
additional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the

Part II of this study focuses on the development and implementation of an intelligent algorithm for the accurate location of multiple active AE sources. The algorithm uses a combination of time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) and amplitude-difference-of-arrival (ADOA) techniques to estimate the 3D coordinates of each source. The algorithm is evaluated using simulated and experimental data, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in accurately locating multiple active AE sources. The proposed algorithm has potential applications in various fields, including aerospace, civil engineering, and material science, where the detection and location of defects are critical for ensuring the safety and reliability of structures and materials.",2007-05-23,True

Quantum Field Theory on Curved Backgrounds. II. Spacetime Symmetries,"  We study space-time symmetries in scalar quantum field theory (including
interacting theories) on static space-times. We first consider Euclidean
quantum field theory on a static Riemannian manifold, and show that the
isometry group is generated by one-parameter subgroups which have either

"Potassium intercalation in graphite: A van der Waals density-functional
  study","  Potassium intercalation in graphite is investigated by first-principles
theory. The bonding in the potassium-graphite compound is reasonably well
accounted for by traditional semilocal density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. However, to investigate the intercalate formation energy from
pure potassium atoms and graphite requires use of a description of the graphite
interlayer binding and thus a consistent account of the nonlocal dispersive
interactions. This is included seamlessly with ordinary DFT by a van der Waals
density functional (vdW-DF) approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. The
use of the vdW-DF is found to stabilize the graphite crystal, with crystal
parameters in fair agreement with experiments. For graphite and
potassium-intercalated graphite structural parameters such as binding
separation, layer binding energy, formation energy, and bulk modulus are

resources and die out. But I shall show that the quantum mechanical principle
of unitarity (actually a form of teleology!) requires intelligent life to
survive to the end of time. Finally, I shall argue that, if the universe is
indeed accelerating, then survival to the end of time requires that intelligent
life, though rare, to have evolved several times in the visible universe. I
shall argue that the acceleration is a consequence of the excess of matter over
antimatter in the universe. I shall suggest experiments to test these claims.

Intelligent Life in Cosmology,"The research paper titled ""Intelligent Life in Cosmology"" by Nikodem Poplawski aims to explore the possibility of the existence of intelligent life in the universe. The main objective of the paper is to propose a novel approach to the Fermi paradox, which questions why we have not yet detected any signs of intelligent life in the universe despite the high probability of its existence. 

The paper suggests that the universe may contain a network of wormholes, which could facilitate interstellar travel and communication between intelligent civilizations. The existence of such wormholes would explain why we have not yet detected any signals from other civilizations, as they may be communicating through these channels rather than traditional radio waves.

The paper also discusses the concept of the multiverse, proposing that the laws of physics may differ in other universes, which may lead to the evolution of intelligent life in different forms. This idea suggests that the lack of communication between civilizations could be due to fundamental differences in their physical laws.

Overall, the paper proposes innovative ideas that challenge traditional notions of the Fermi paradox and the search for intelligent life in the universe. While the claims presented in the paper are speculative, they provide a thought-provoking approach to understanding the potential existence and communication of intelligent life in the cosmos.",2015-05-13,True

"Lagrangian quantum field theory in momentum picture. IV. Commutation
  relations for free fields","  Possible (algebraic) commutation relations in the Lagrangian quantum theory
of free (scalar, spinor and vector) fields are considered from mathematical
view-point. As sources of these relations are employed the Heisenberg
equations/relations for the dynamical variables and a specific condition for
uniqueness of the operators of the dynamical variables (with respect to some
class of Lagrangians). The paracommutation relations or some their
generalizations are pointed as the most general ones that entail the validity
of all Heisenberg equations. The simultaneous fulfillment of the Heisenberg
equations and the uniqueness requirement turn to be impossible. This problem is
solved via a redefinition of the dynamical variables, similar to the normal
ordering procedure and containing it as a special case. That implies
corresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations. The introduction
of the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutation
relations; in particular, the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variables
is reduced to normal ordering. As a last restriction on that class is imposed
the requirement for existing of an effective procedure for calculating vacuum
mean values. The standard bilinear commutation relations are pointed as the
only known ones that satisfy all of the mentioned conditions and do not

Order of Epitaxial Self-Assembled Quantum Dots: Linear Analysis,"  Epitaxial self-assembled quantum dots (SAQDs) are of interest for
nanostructured optoelectronic and electronic devices such as lasers,
photodetectors and nanoscale logic. Spatial order and size order of SAQDs are
important to the development of usable devices. It is likely that these two
types of order are strongly linked; thus, a study of spatial order will also
have strong implications for size order. Here a study of spatial order is
undertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of SAQD formation
based on surface diffusion. Analytic formulas for film-height correlation
functions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order and
corresponding correlation lengths that quantify order. Initial atomic-scale
random fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths (about two
dots) when the effect of a wetting potential is negligible; however, the
correlation lengths diverge when SAQDs are allowed to form at a near-critical
film height. The present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy and
SAQD order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering with
corresponding analytic equations. In addition, SAQD formation is by its nature

Dynamical Objects for Cohomologically Expanding Maps,"  The goal of this paper is to construct invariant dynamical objects for a (not
necessarily invertible) smooth self map of a compact manifold. We prove a
result that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms
of a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite
dimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant
subspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological
classes and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given
type, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes
and are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a
plethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is
important. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth
rate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives
sufficient ""marching orders"" to the system to prohibit the formation of any
other such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical
subsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give
conditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf
containing it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf
cohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified
with the deRham cohomology groups. Our main theorem can be applied in both the
smooth and holomorphic setting.

Why there is something rather than nothing (out of everything)?,"  The path integral over Euclidean geometries for the recently suggested

cosmological instantons limited to a bounded range of the cosmological
constant. Inflationary cosmologies generated by these instantons at late stages
of expansion undergo acceleration whose low-energy scale can be attained within
the concept of dynamically evolving extra dimensions. Thus, together with the

A Universality in PP-Waves,"  We discuss a universality property of any covariant field theory in
space-time expanded around pp-wave backgrounds. According to this property the
space-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field
configurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the
pp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the
background scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial
fields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell
pp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal
sector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to
the pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results
can also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also
study such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In
particular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse
space and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition
relating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive
modes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this
simplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on
the two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an
iterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT
equations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analyses

related pairs. One member of a pair agrees with the classical solution and the

Oxygen-rich droplets and the enrichment of the ISM,"  We argue that the discrepancies observed in HII regions between abundances
derived from optical recombination lines (ORLs) and collisionally excited lines

after the last massive supernova explosion, the metal-rich gas starts cooling
down and falls on the galaxy within metal-rich droplets. Full mixing of these
metal-rich droplets and the ISM occurs during photoionization by the next

Data Bank reveals several new knots which, along with previously discovered
ones, can shed light on such connections. In particular, we identify the most
complex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest that
its entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by the
proteasome. Knots in proteins are typically preserved across species and
sometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which only
appears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins of
similar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in the
enzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of a
short DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into a
knotted structure in this protein.

"Quantum mechanical approach to decoherence and relaxation generated by
  fluctuating environment","  We consider an electrostatic qubit, interacting with a fluctuating charge of
single electron transistor (SET) in the framework of exactly solvable model.
The SET plays a role of the fluctuating environment affecting the qubit's
parameters in a controllable way. We derive the rate equations describing
dynamics of the entire system for both weak and strong qubit-SET coupling.
Solving these equation we obtain decoherence and relaxation rates of the qubit,
as well as the spectral density of the fluctuating qubit's parameters. We found
that in the weak coupling regime the decoherence and relaxation rates are
directly related to the spectral density taken at Rabi or at zero frequency,
depending on what a particular qubit's parameters is fluctuating. This relation
holds also in the presence of weak back-action of the qubit on the fluctuating
environment. In the case of strong back-action, such simple relationship no
longer holds, even if the qubit-SET coupling is small. It does not hold either
in the strong-coupling regime, even in the absence of the back-action. In
addition, we found that our model predicts localization of the qubit in the
strong-coupling regime, resembling that of the spin-boson model.

A Spitzer census of the IC 348 nebula,"  We present a Spitzer based census of the IC 348 nebula and embedded star
cluster. Our Spitzer census supplemented by ground based spectra has added 42
class II T-Tauri sources to the cluster membership and identified ~20 class 0/I
protostars. The population of IC 348 likely exceeds 400 sources after
accounting statistically for unidentified diskless members. Our Spitzer census
of IC 348 reveals a population of protostars that is anti-correlated spatially
with the T-Tauri members, which comprise the centrally condensed cluster around
a B star. The protostars are instead found mostly at the cluster periphery
about 1 pc from the B star and spread out along a filamentary ridge. We find
that the star formation rate in this protostellar ridge is consistent with that
rate which built the exposed cluster while the presence of fifteen cold,
starless, millimeter cores intermingled with this protostellar population
indicates that the IC 348 nebula has yet to finish forming stars. We show that
the IC 348 cluster is of order 3-5 crossing times old, and, as evidenced by its
smooth radial profile and confirmed mass segregation, is likely relaxed. While
it seems apparent that the current cluster configuration is the result of
dynamical evolution and its primordial structure has been erased, our findings

"Capacity of a Multiple-Antenna Fading Channel with a Quantized Precoding
  Matrix","  Given a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel, feedback from the
receiver can be used to specify a transmit precoding matrix, which selectively
activates the strongest channel modes. Here we analyze the performance of
Random Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected
from a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed
entries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,
which relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the
transmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of
beamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system
refers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go
to infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,
i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The
performance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar
quantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random
subspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and
approximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers
(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show
that these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size
systems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples
show that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only
slightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched
filter can require significantly more feedback.

"Geometric Complexity Theory VI: the flip via saturated and positive
  integer programming in representation theory and algebraic geometry","  This article belongs to a series on geometric complexity theory (GCT), an
approach to the P vs. NP and related problems through algebraic geometry and
representation theory. The basic principle behind this approach is called the
flip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the
lower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to
the positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems):
specifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the
fundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic
geometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed
forms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this
article, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that
these relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of
the preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical
positivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive
formulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural
constants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These
turn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the
Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the
canonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum
groups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann
hypothesis over finite fields and the related results. Thus the reduction here,
in conjunction with the flip, in essence, says that the validity of the P vs.
NP conjecture in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the Riemann
hypothesis over finite fields and related problems.

Using a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, the study shows that the vertex and non-local corrections can significantly alter the superconducting properties of the system. The key results suggest that the vertex correction enhances the critical temperature while the non-local correction suppresses it.

One-loop MHV Rules and Pure Yang-Mills,"  It has been known for some time that the standard MHV diagram formulation of
perturbative Yang-Mills theory is incomplete, as it misses rational terms in
one-loop scattering amplitudes of pure Yang-Mills. We propose that certain

Formation and Collisional Evolution of Kuiper Belt Objects,"  This chapter summarizes analytic theory and numerical calculations for the

Common Envelope Evolution Redux,"  Common envelopes form in dynamical time scale mass exchange, when the
envelope of a donor star engulfs a much denser companion, and the core of the
donor plus the dense companion star spiral inward through this dissipative
envelope. As conceived by Paczynski and Ostriker, this process must be
responsible for the creation of short-period binaries with degenerate
components, and, indeed, it has proven capable of accounting for short-period
binaries containing one white dwarf component. However, attempts to reconstruct
the evolutionary histories of close double white dwarfs have proven more
problematic, and point to the need for enhanced systemic mass loss, either
during the close of the first, slow episode of mass transfer that produced the
first white dwarf, or during the detached phase preceding the final, common
envelope episode. The survival of long-period interacting binaries with massive
white dwarfs, such as the recurrent novae T CrB and RS Oph, also presents
interpretative difficulties for simple energetic treatments of common envelope
evolution. Their existence implies that major terms are missing from usual
formulations of the energy budget for common envelope evolution. The most

The core binary fractions of star clusters from realistic simulations,"  We investigate the evolution of binary fractions in star clusters using
N-body models of up to 100000 stars. Primordial binary frequencies in these
models range from 5% to 50%. Simulations are performed with the NBODY4 code and
include a full mass spectrum of stars, stellar evolution, binary evolution and
the tidal field of the Galaxy. We find that the overall binary fraction of a
cluster almost always remains close to the primordial value, except at late
times when a cluster is near dissolution. A critical exception occurs in the
central regions where we observe a marked increase in binary fraction with time
-- a simulation starting with 100000 stars and 5% binaries reached a core
binary frequency as high as 40% at the end of the core-collapse phase
(occurring at 16 Gyr with ~20000 stars remaining). Binaries are destroyed in
the core by a variety of processes as a cluster evolves, but the combination of
mass-segregation and creation of new binaries in exchange interactions produces
the observed increase in relative number. We also find that binaries are cycled
into and out of cluster cores in a manner that is analogous to convection in
stars. For models of 100000 stars we show that the evolution of the core-radius
up to the end of the initial phase of core-collapse is not affected by the
exact value of the primordial binary frequency (for frequencies of 10% or
less). We discuss the ramifications of our results for the likely primordial
binary content of globular clusters.

Approaching the Heisenberg limit in an atom laser,"  We present experimental and theoretical results showing the improved beam
quality and reduced divergence of an atom laser produced by an optical Raman

outcoupling can eliminate the diverging lens effect that the condensate has on
the outcoupled atoms. This substantially improves the beam quality of the atom
laser, and the improvement may be greater than a factor of ten for experiments

Parametrized Post-Newtonian Expansion of Chern-Simons Gravity,"  We investigate the weak-field, post-Newtonian expansion to the solution of
the field equations in Chern-Simons gravity with a perfect fluid source. In

vector potentials. We also find that the new term is naturally enhanced by the
non-linearity of spacetime and we provide a physical interpretation for it. By
mapping this correction to the gravito-electro-magnetic framework, we study the
corrections that this new term introduces to the acceleration of point
particles and the frame-dragging effect in gyroscopic precession. We find that

Spline Single-Index Prediction Model,"  For the past two decades, single-index model, a special case of projection
pursuit regression, has proven to be an efficient way of coping with the high

"Measurement of the Aerosol Phase Function at the Pierre Auger

Periodic accretion from a circumbinary disk in the young binary UZ Tau E,"  Close pre-main-sequence binary stars are expected to clear central holes in
their protoplanetary disks, but the extent to which material can flow from the
circumbinary disk across the gap onto the individual circumstellar disks has
been unclear. In binaries with eccentric orbits, periodic perturbation of the
outer disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap, resulting in
accretion that varies with the binary period. This accretion may manifest
itself observationally as periodic changes in luminosity. Here we present a
search for such periodic accretion in the pre-main-sequence spectroscopic
binary UZ Tau E. We present BVRI photometry spanning three years; we find that
the brightness of UZ Tau E is clearly periodic, with a best-fit period of 19.16
+/- 0.04 days. This is consistent with the spectroscopic binary period of 19.13
days, refined here from analysis of new and existing radial velocity data. The
brightness of UZ Tau E shows significant random variability, but the overall
periodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more than
half the binary orbital period. The variability of the H-alpha line is not as
clearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic component
is not ruled out. The photometric variations are in good agreement with
predictions from simulations of binaries with orbital parameters similar to
those of UZ Tau E, suggesting that periodic accretion does occur from
circumbinary disks, replenishing the inner disks and possibly extending the
timescale over which they might form planets.

Periodic accretion from a circumbinary disk in the young binary UZ Tau E,"The research paper titled ""Periodic accretion from a circumbinary disk in the young binary UZ Tau E"" aims to investigate the accretion processes in young binary systems using the example of UZ Tau E.

The study found that the accretion rate in UZ Tau E is periodic and synchronized with the orbital period of the binary system. This suggests that the accretion is driven by the gravitational interaction between the binary components and the circumbinary disk. The study also found that the accretion variability is caused by the interaction between the binary companions and the disk, which causes changes in the disk structure and accretion flow.

The study concludes that the periodic accretion from a circumbinary disk is a common phenomenon in young binary systems and plays an important role in the evolution of these systems.

Effect of node deleting on network structure,"  The ever-increasing knowledge of the structure of various real-world networks
has uncovered their complex multi-mechanism-governed evolution processes.
Therefore, a better understanding of the structure and evolution of these
networked complex systems requires us to describe such processes in a more
detailed and realistic manner. In this paper, we introduce a new type of
network growth rule which comprises addition and deletion of nodes, and propose
an evolving network model to investigate the effect of node deleting on network
structure. It is found that, with the introduction of node deleting, network
structure is significantly transformed. In particular, degree distribution of
the network undergoes a transition from scale-free to exponential forms as the
intensity of node deleting increases. At the same time, nontrivial
disassortative degree correlation develops spontaneously as a natural result of
network evolution in the model. We also demonstrate that node deleting
introduced in the model does not destroy the connectedness of a growing network
so long as the increasing rate of edges is not excessively small. In addition,
it is found that node deleting will weaken but not eliminate the small-world

Moment switching in nanotube magnetic force probes,"  A recent advance in improving the spatial resolution of magnetic force

sample was selected to investigate whether objects of this kind could be relics

infrared-luminous broad absorption line (BAL) quasar. It is a young CSS object
whose asymmetric two-sided morphology on a scale of several hundred parsecs,
extending in two different directions, may suggest intermittent activity. The

AMR simulations of the low T/|W| bar-mode instability of neutron stars,"  It has been recently argued through numerical work that rotating stars with a
high degree of differential rotation are dynamically unstable against bar-mode

corotation radius of the star leads to the saturation of the bar-mode
deformation. While the overall trends reported in an earlier investigation are

Evolutionary games on minimally structured populations,"  Population structure induced by both spatial embedding and more general
networks of interaction, such as model social networks, have been shown to have
a fundamental effect on the dynamics and outcome of evolutionary games. These
effects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlying
topology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that is
described by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe this
model is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend on
the details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of
a system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes
through two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population
structure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the
effective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local
dynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a
continuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations
with hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio
becomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatial
structure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel and
counterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustains
cooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner's
dilemma and also of the ""rock-paper-scissor"" game we find indications of rich

Torsional oscillations of longitudinally inhomogeneous coronal loops,"  We explore the effect of an inhomogeneous mass density field on frequencies

frequency reduction results from the decrease of an average Alfven speed as far
as the inhomogeneous loop is denser at its footpoints. The derived dispersion

different spin states, represented by a double Fock state. Individual
measurements of the spins of the particles are performed in transverse
directions, giving access to the relative phase of the condensates. Initially,
this phase is completely undefined, and the first measurements provide random
results. But a fixed value of this phase rapidly emerges under the effect of
the successive quantum measurements, giving rise to a quasi-classical situation
where all spins have parallel transverse orientations. If the number of
measurements reaches its maximum (the number of particles), quantum effects
show up again, giving rise to violations of Bell type inequalities. The
violation of BCHSH inequalities with an arbitrarily large number of spins may
be comparable (or even equal) to that obtained with two spins.

"Evolution of the Carter constant for inspirals into a black hole: effect
  of the black hole quadrupole","  We analyze the effect of gravitational radiation reaction on generic orbits
around a body with an axisymmetric mass quadrupole moment Q to linear order in
Q, to the leading post-Newtonian order, and to linear order in the mass ratio.
This system admits three constants of the motion in absence of radiation
reaction: energy, angular momentum, and a third constant analogous to the
Carter constant. We compute instantaneous and time-averaged rates of change of
these three constants. For a point particle orbiting a black hole, Ryan has
computed the leading order evolution of the orbit's Carter constant, which is
linear in the spin. Our result, when combined with an interaction quadratic in
the spin (the coupling of the black hole's spin to its own radiation reaction
field), gives the next to leading order evolution. The effect of the
quadrupole, like that of the linear spin term, is to circularize eccentric
orbits and to drive the orbital plane towards antialignment with the symmetry
axis. In addition we consider a system of two point masses where one body has a
single mass multipole or current multipole. To linear order in the mass ratio,
to linear order in the multipole, and to the leading post-Newtonian order, we
show that there does not exist an analog of the Carter constant for such a
system (except for the cases of spin and mass quadrupole). With mild additional
assumptions, this result falsifies the conjecture that all vacuum, axisymmetric
spacetimes posess a third constant of geodesic motion.

"Geometrically Engineering the Standard Model: Locally Unfolding Three
  Families out of E8","  This paper extends and builds upon the results of an earlier paper, in which
we described how to use the tools of geometrical engineering to deform
geometrically-engineered grand unified models into ones with lower symmetry.
This top-down unfolding has the advantage that the relative positions of
singularities giving rise to the many `low energy' matter fields are related by
only a few parameters which deform the geometry of the unified model. And
because the relative positions of singularities are necessary to compute the
superpotential, for example, this is a framework in which the arbitrariness of
geometrically engineered models can be greatly reduced.
  In our earlier paper, this picture was made concrete for the case of
deforming the representations of an SU(5) model into their Standard Model
content. In this paper we continue that discussion to show how a geometrically

Giant Planet Migration in Viscous Power-Law Discs,"  Many extra-solar planets discovered over the past decade are gas giants in
tight orbits around their host stars. Due to the difficulties of forming these
`hot Jupiters' in situ, they are generally assumed to have migrated to their
present orbits through interactions with their nascent discs. In this paper, we
present a systematic study of giant planet migration in power law discs. We
find that the planetary migration rate is proportional to the disc surface
density. This is inconsistent with the assumption that the migration rate is
simply the viscous drift speed of the disc. However, this result can be
obtained by balancing the angular momentum of the planet with the viscous
torque in the disc. We have verified that this result is not affected by
adjusting the resolution of the grid, the smoothing length used, or the time at
which the planet is released to migrate.

Modeling Accretion Disk X-ray Continuum of Black Hole Candidates,"  We critically examine issues associated with determining the fundamental
properties of the black hole and the surrounding accretion disk in an X-ray

work mainly on two XMM-Newton observations of GX 339-4, because they provided
high-quality data at low energies (below 1 keV) which are critical for reliably
modeling the spectrum of the accretion disk. A key issue examined is the
determination of the so-called ""color correction factor"", which is often
empirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrum
from a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This factor cannot be
pre-determined theoretically because it may vary with, e.g., mass accretion
rate, among a number of important factors. We follow up on an earlier
suggestion to estimate the color correction observationally by modeling the
disk spectrum with saturated Compton scattering. We show that the spectra can
be fitted well and the approach yields reasonable values for the color
correction factor. For comparison, we have also attempted to fit the spectra

by using the canonical Monte Carlo simulations with dynamical triangulations.
The mechanical strength of the surface is given only by skeletons, and no
two-dimensional bending energy is assumed in the Hamiltonian. The skeletons are
composed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form a
compartmentalized structure on the surface, and for this reason the vertices of
triangles can diffuse freely only inside the compartments. As a consequence, an
inhomogeneous structure is introduced in the model; the surface strength inside
the compartments is different from the surface strength on the compartments.
However, the rotational symmetry is not influenced by the elastic skeletons;
there is no specific direction on the surface. In addition to the three phases
mentioned above, a collapsed phase is expected to exist in the low bending
rigidity regime that was not studied here. The inhomogeneous structure and the
fluidity of vertices are considered to be the origin of such variety of phases.

"Vortex Dynamics at the Initial Stage of Resistive Transition in
  Superconductors with Fractal Cluster Structure","  The effect of fractal normal-phase clusters on vortex dynamics in a
percolative superconductor is considered. The superconductor contains
percolative superconducting cluster carrying a transport current and clusters
of a normal phase, acting as pinning centers. A prototype of such a structure
is YBCO film, containing clusters of columnar defects, as well as the BSCCO/Ag
sheathed tape, which is of practical interest for wire fabrication. Transition
of the superconductor into a resistive state corresponds to the percolation
transition from a pinned vortex state to a resistive state when the vortices
are free to move. The dependencies of the free vortex density on the fractal
dimension of the cluster boundary as well as the resistance on the transport
current are obtained. It is revealed that a mixed state of the vortex glass
type is realized in the superconducting system involved. The current-voltage
characteristics of superconductors containing fractal clusters are obtained and
their features are studied.

"Vortex Dynamics at the Initial Stage of Resistive Transition in
  Superconductors with Fractal Cluster Structure",This research paper investigates the vortex dynamics in superconductors with a fractal cluster structure at the initial stage of resistive transition. The primary theme is to understand the influence of the fractal dimension of the cluster structure on the vortex dynamics. The study finds that the fractal dimension affects the vortex motion and the critical current density of the superconductor at the initial stage of resistive transition. The results suggest that the fractal dimension can be used as a control parameter to optimize the properties of superconductors for various applications.,2015-05-13,True
The Veldkamp Space of Two-Qubits,"  Given a remarkable representation of the generalized Pauli operators of
two-qubits in terms of the points of the generalized quadrangle of order two,
W(2), it is shown that specific subsets of these operators can also be
associated with the points and lines of the four-dimensional projective space
over the Galois field with two elements - the so-called Veldkamp space of W(2).
An intriguing novelty is the recognition of (uni- and tri-centric) triads and
specific pentads of the Pauli operators in addition to the ""classical"" subsets
answering to geometric hyperplanes of W(2).

The Veldkamp Space of Two-Qubits,"The Veldkamp space of two-qubits is a mathematical object that describes the possible geometric arrangements of two qubits in a quantum system. In this paper, we explore the properties of this space and its applications in quantum information theory. We provide a detailed analysis of the structure and geometry of the Veldkamp space, including its symmetries and invariants. We also examine the relationship between the Veldkamp space and other important mathematical objects in quantum information theory, such as the Bloch sphere and the Pauli group. Our results demonstrate the utility of the Veldkamp space in characterizing the entanglement properties of two-qubit systems and in designing quantum error-correcting codes. Overall, our findings have important implications for the development of practical quantum technologies and the understanding of fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.",2007-07-02,True
"Fusion process studied with preequilibrium giant dipole resonance in
  time dependent Hartree-Fock theory","  The equilibration of macroscopic degrees of freedom during the fusion of
heavy nuclei, like the charge and the shape, are studied in the Time-Dependent
Hartree-Fock theory. The pre-equilibrium Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) is used
to probe the fusion path. It is shown that such isovector collective state is
excited in N/Z asymmetric fusion and to a less extent in mass asymmetric
systems. The characteristics of this GDR are governed by the structure of the
fused system in its preequilibrium phase, like its deformation, rotation and
vibration. In particular, we show that a lowering of the pre-equilibrium GDR
energy is expected as compared to the statistical one. Revisiting experimental
data, we extract an evidence of this lowering for the first time. We also
quantify the fusion-evaporation enhancement due to gamma-ray emission from the
pre-equilibrium GDR. This cooling mechanism along the fusion path may be
suitable to synthesize in the future super heavy elements using radioactive
beams with strong N/Z asymmetries in the entrance channel.
