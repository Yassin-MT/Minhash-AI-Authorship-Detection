The research paper titled "Iron Line Profiles from Relativistic Thick Accretion Disk" aims to investigate the iron line profiles generated by a thick accretion disk around a black hole. The researchers use numerical simulations to study the spectral features that arise from the disk's structure and motion.  The main objective of the study is to determine the effects of the thickness of the accretion disk on the iron line profiles. The researchers find that the line profiles are significantly broadened due to the thick disk, and that this effect is more pronounced for higher inclinations.  The study also investigates the impact of the black hole spin on the iron line profiles. The researchers find that the spin can significantly affect the shape and width of the line profiles, particularly for thick disks.  Overall, the study provides insights into the spectral features of thick accretion disks around black holes and highlights the importance of considering the disk's structure and motion in interpreting observational data. The findings have implications for understanding the physics of black hole accretion and for interpreting X-ray observations of active galactic nuclei and black hole binaries.

This research paper investigates the underlying causes of fragility in supercooled Lennard-Jones mixtures by analyzing the potential energy surface. The fragility of these mixtures is a well-known phenomenon, characterized by a rapid increase in viscosity with decreasing temperature. By exploring the potential energy surface, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics and structural changes that occur in supercooled mixtures. Our results suggest that the fragility of Lennard-Jones mixtures is closely related to the complexity of the potential energy surface, which exhibits a high degree of roughness and heterogeneity. This study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms that govern the behavior of supercooled mixtures, with potential applications in fields such as materials science and chemical engineering.

The article "Transverse LS-Category for Riemannian Foliations" focuses on the study of Riemannian foliations, which are a type of geometric structure that can be used to describe certain types of smooth manifolds. The article introduces a new concept called the transverse LS-category, which is a measure of the complexity of the foliation in terms of the topology of the transverse space. The article provides several results and examples of how the transverse LS-category can be used to understand the structure of Riemannian foliations. Noteworthy outcomes include the development of new tools for studying Riemannian foliations, and the identification of new classes of foliations with interesting geometric properties. Overall, the article contributes to the field of differential geometry and provides a deeper understanding of the structure and behavior of Riemannian foliations.

This research paper explores non-Abelian plasma instabilities in two spatial dimensions and draws lessons from them. The study shows how these instabilities can lead to the formation of complex structures in the plasma, such as magnetic vortices and filaments. The findings suggest that these instabilities can play a crucial role in the dynamics of non-Abelian plasmas, and can have implications for a range of fields, including astrophysics and fusion energy research. Ultimately, the paper highlights the importance of further research into non-Abelian plasma instabilities to gain a deeper understanding of the behavior of these complex systems.

This research paper explores the behavior of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in one dimension at a nonzero chemical potential. We investigate the phase structure of this system and analyze the effects of temperature and chemical potential on the system's properties. Our results show that the system exhibits a rich phase structure, including a chiral condensate phase and a superfluid phase. Moreover, we found that the phase structure is strongly influenced by the chemical potential, which has the potential to significantly impact the fundamental understanding of QCD. Our study has important implications for the study of QCD and sheds light on the possible behavior of this system in extreme conditions.

Heavy-quark jets are important in many of today's collider studies and searches, yet predictions for them are subject to much larger uncertainties than for light jets. This is because of strong enhancements in higher orders from large logarithms, ln(p_t/m_Q). We propose a new definition of heavy-quark jets, which is free of final-state logarithms to all orders and such that all initial-state collinear logarithms can be resummed into the heavy-quark parton distributions. Heavy-jet spectra can then be calculated in the massless approximation, which is simpler than a massive calculation and reduces the theoretical uncertainties by a factor of three. This provides the first ever accurate predictions for inclusive b- and c-jets, and the latter have significant discriminatory power for the intrinsic charm content of the proton. The techniques introduced here could be used to obtain heavy-flavour jet results from existing massless next-to-leading order calculations for a wide range of processes. We also discuss the experimental applicability of our flavoured jet definition.

This paper characterizes the capacity of a class of modulo additive noise relay channels, in which the relay observes a corrupted version of the noise and has a separate channel to the destination. The capacity is shown to be strictly below the cut-set bound in general and achievable using a quantize-and-forward strategy at the relay. This result confirms a conjecture by Ahlswede and Han about the capacity of channels with rate limited state information at the destination for this particular class of channels.

We report a detailed spectroscopic study of the pressure induced neutral-ionic phase transition (NIT) of the mixed-stack charge-transfer (CT) crystal tetrathiafulvalene-chloranil (TTF-CA). We show that the pressure induced phase transition is still first-order and involves the presence of an intermediate disordered phase, defined by the coexistence of two species of different ionicity. Further application of pressure gradually converts this phase into an homogeneous ferroelectric phase with a single ionicity. In addition, we detect strong pretransitional phenomena which anticipate the intermediate phase and are indicative of a precursor dynamic regime dominated by fluctuations.

Thermally stable polymers have attracted a lot of interest due to their potential use as the active component in electronic, optical and optoelectronic applications, such as light-emitting diodes, light emitting electrochemical cells, photodiodes, photovoltaic cells, field effect transistors, optocouplers and optically pumped lasers in solution and solid state.We report results of investigations into the use of thermal treatment of poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) films grown on a variety of substrates (quartz and glass). Film thickness, morphology and structural properties were investigated by a range of techniques in particular: atomic force microscope - AFM, DEKTAK method, Ellipsometry and UV-VIS spectroscopy.

We extend our approach to abstract syntax (with binding constructions) through modules and linearity. First we give a new general definition of arity, yielding the companion notion of signature. Then we obtain a modularity result as requested by Ghani and Uustalu (2003): in our setting, merging two extensions of syntax corresponds to building an amalgamated sum. Finally we define a natural notion of equation concerning a signature and prove the existence of an initial semantics for a so-called representable signature equipped with a set of equations.
